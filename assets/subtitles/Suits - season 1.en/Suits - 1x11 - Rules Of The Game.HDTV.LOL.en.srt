1
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:13,510
Are you watching me?

2
00:00:13,511 --> 00:00:14,878
Do I look dashing?

3
00:00:14,912 --> 00:00:16,742
Nobody says dashing.

4
00:00:16,777 --> 00:00:18,311
James Bond says dashing.

5
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:19,512
You think you're James Bond?

6
00:00:19,547 --> 00:00:21,620
I could be James Bond.

7
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:23,658
I've got Connery's swagger...

8
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:27,303
Definitely
Daniel Craig's physique...

9
00:00:27,337 --> 00:00:29,672
Lazenby's...

10
00:00:29,706 --> 00:00:33,476
I have no idea
what he's known for.

11
00:00:33,513 --> 00:00:36,151
You okay?

12
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:38,353
I had an interesting
conversation

13
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:41,523
with Louis last night.

14
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:44,694
He said I should be careful
of you and Rachel.

15
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:46,496
Do I have anything
to worry about?

16
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:47,631
No.

17
00:00:47,665 --> 00:00:49,065
He hates me,

18
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:52,168
and he's just trying
to get to me through you.

19
00:00:52,203 --> 00:00:54,203
So you never--

20
00:00:54,237 --> 00:00:55,371
No.

21
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:57,339
You got nothing
to worry about.

22
00:00:57,373 --> 00:00:58,640
She's just a friend.

23
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:02,612
- Okay.
- And I'm late.

24
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:03,714
I'll call.

25
00:01:03,748 --> 00:01:07,586
- Okay.
- Okay.

26
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,725
We should go out.

27
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:12,393
Uh, this is going out.

28
00:01:12,427 --> 00:01:16,299
No, I mean you and me
and Rachel

29
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,300
should go on a double date.

30
00:01:17,334 --> 00:01:19,101
Does she have a-a boyfriend?

31
00:01:19,136 --> 00:01:21,370
I, uh, don't know.

32
00:01:21,404 --> 00:01:22,605
No.

33
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:25,008
Going on a double date
with somebody from work

34
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,376
might be kind of weird.

35
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:28,346
If I get to know her,
then I won't worry.

36
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,614
- [Sighs]
- It'll be fun.

37
00:01:29,648 --> 00:01:31,282
Just a couple friends
going out.

38
00:01:31,317 --> 00:01:33,485
Right?

39
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,421
Awesome.

40
00:01:43,163 --> 00:01:45,164
[Horns blaring]

41
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:05,826
Cab?
Someone steal your bike?

42
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:07,995
I have a lot on my mind.
It's a safety issue.

43
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,164
What are you talking about?

44
00:02:09,198 --> 00:02:10,499
Louis told Jenny
about Rachel and me.

45
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:12,500
It was one kiss,
and she kissed me.

46
00:02:12,535 --> 00:02:14,636
Okay, Soap Opera,
just give me my documents.

47
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,673
Harvey.

48
00:02:17,707 --> 00:02:19,908
Cameron.

49
00:02:19,943 --> 00:02:21,443
How the hell are you?

50
00:02:21,478 --> 00:02:23,279
- Good to see you.
- Wow.

51
00:02:23,313 --> 00:02:24,680
Too damn long.

52
00:02:24,714 --> 00:02:25,781
Cameron Dennis,
district attorney,

53
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:27,316
meet Mike Ross,
my associate.

54
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,018
Hi.

55
00:02:29,052 --> 00:02:31,253
I guess that makes you
his Harvey.

56
00:02:31,288 --> 00:02:32,621
- I'm sorry?
- Harvey was my associate.

57
00:02:32,655 --> 00:02:34,556
I taught him everything
he knows.

58
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:37,826
Best A.D.A. to come up
since me.

59
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:41,264
- You taught him?
- "Never go to court."

60
00:02:41,298 --> 00:02:42,599
That's me.

61
00:02:42,634 --> 00:02:44,268
"It's not about caring.
It's about winning."

62
00:02:44,302 --> 00:02:45,269
Me.

63
00:02:45,304 --> 00:02:46,804
No way.
Harvey's Harvey.

64
00:02:46,838 --> 00:02:49,307
[Laughing]
Yeah, exactly.

65
00:02:49,341 --> 00:02:51,977
We should, uh,
catch up, have lunch.

66
00:02:52,012 --> 00:02:53,646
Hey, you know what?
This is crazy.

67
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:54,681
I'm free for dinner tonight.

68
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:56,115
Just cancel whatever you have,

69
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,019
and tell Jessica I demanded
that you clear your schedule.

70
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:02,356
Dinner it is.
It'd be nice.

71
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,225
That's my boy.

72
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:06,394
All right, you know where
to find me, 8:00.

73
00:03:06,428 --> 00:03:08,429
Glad I ran into you, Harvey.

74
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:19,340
Ross, you still work here?

75
00:03:19,374 --> 00:03:20,541
Funny.

76
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:21,910
Yeah, 'cause I thought
after I beat you--

77
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:22,911
Yeah, I got it.

78
00:03:22,945 --> 00:03:27,483
- Thanks for expediting.
- Yeah.

79
00:03:27,517 --> 00:03:29,752
Hi.

80
00:03:29,786 --> 00:03:33,723
Hi.

81
00:03:33,757 --> 00:03:35,792
Do you need something?

82
00:03:35,826 --> 00:03:37,827
Did you know that Harvey,
uh, was a prosecutor?

83
00:03:37,862 --> 00:03:39,262
- No, he wasn't.
- Yeah, he was.

84
00:03:39,297 --> 00:03:40,497
I've read every bio
at the firm.

85
00:03:40,531 --> 00:03:41,732
People work
for the D.A.'s office,

86
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:43,000
it's on their bio.

87
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:44,602
Well, we ran into
Cameron Dennis this morning.

88
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:46,103
- The D.A.?
- Yeah.

89
00:03:46,137 --> 00:03:49,006
He says that Harvey's
the best A.D.A. he's ever had.

90
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,542
No. Come here.

91
00:03:51,577 --> 00:03:53,277
See? Nothing about being
a prosecutor.

92
00:03:53,312 --> 00:03:54,379
Yeah.

93
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:55,713
I need you to go
on a double date

94
00:03:55,748 --> 00:03:57,448
with me and Jenny.

95
00:03:57,483 --> 00:03:58,616
Yeah, not gonna happen.

96
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,918
You have to.
Listen to me.

97
00:04:00,953 --> 00:04:03,088
Louis warned her
about you and me.

98
00:04:03,122 --> 00:04:04,423
Wha--

99
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:05,491
how did even get--

100
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:06,792
You know how.

101
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:08,895
'Cause he walked in
right after you kissed me.

102
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:10,196
If you say no,
she's gonna think

103
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:11,798
something's going on
between us.

104
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,535
Okay.
I'll go.

105
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:17,739
- Thank you.
- Freakin' Louis.

106
00:04:17,773 --> 00:04:20,375
Oh, is this Harvey?

107
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,411
Okay, you are definitely
sending me that photo.

108
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:24,813
Westlaw lists him
as prosecutor of record

109
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,215
on pages and pages
of cases.

110
00:04:27,249 --> 00:04:28,883
- Told you.
- I don't get it.

111
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:30,118
Why wouldn't he have this
on his bio?

112
00:04:30,152 --> 00:04:31,386
Because.

113
00:04:31,531 --> 00:04:33,158
Maybe he has something
to hide.

It touches some idealistic
core of your being,

126
00:05:11,147 --> 00:05:14,650
where even the greatest cynic
has not given up hope.

127
00:05:14,684 --> 00:05:15,951
That's why we listen
to music.

128
00:05:15,985 --> 00:05:17,619
Oh, that's beautiful, Louis.

129
00:05:17,654 --> 00:05:18,754
Really.

130
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:20,555
And I think your decision
to leave law

131
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,623
to become
a music critic

132
00:05:21,657 --> 00:05:23,192
is in everyone's
best interests.

133
00:05:23,226 --> 00:05:24,927
Okay, I was quoting
Peter Sellers.

134
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:27,996
I just got $1,000-a-head tickets
to <i>Nixon in China.</i>

135
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,399
Are you two dating now?
Should I come back?

136
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:32,833
Sit down, Harvey.

137
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:34,335
Love it when you talk to me

138
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:38,139
like my third grade teacher,
Mrs. Coe.

139
00:05:38,174 --> 00:05:40,241
Gentlemen.

140
00:05:40,275 --> 00:05:42,043
Malcolm Price died last week.

141
00:05:42,077 --> 00:05:43,878
Truly great loss
for humanity.

142
00:05:43,912 --> 00:05:45,713
You want to mock the dead?
Fine.

143
00:05:45,747 --> 00:05:48,382
But his tabloid,
<i>Nothing But the Truth,</i>

144
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,516
has made us a fortune.

145
00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:53,386
Price has left his estate,
ten companies,

146
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,755
including the tabloid,
to his two daughters,

147
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,156
Madison and Kelsey.

148
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,825
We have been asked
to divide the assets up fairly.

149
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,193
And I'm here why?

150
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:02,394
Because they hate
each other.

151
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,695
Malcolm structured the will

152
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,863
to bring them back together.

153
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,999
You have a knack
for bringing parties together

154
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:09,701
who don't see eye to eye.

155
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:10,768
So why is he here?

156
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:12,537
Because Madison Price
requested him.

157
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:15,307
You sure she's not mixing him
up with me?

158
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,542
Hardman had me do

159
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,177
some contract work for her
a couple years back,

160
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,611
so I guess I made
an impression.

161
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:20,746
Right.

162
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,914
So you each get a sister.

163
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,683
You think pitting us
against each other

164
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,752
is fair to Louis' client?

165
00:06:25,787 --> 00:06:27,888
Please.
Dividing financial assets?

166
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:29,556
- You couldn't shine my shoes.
- Someone should.

167
00:06:29,591 --> 00:06:31,158
Well, actually,
I personally shine my own shoes,

168
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:32,392
so there you go.

169
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,194
- Oh, lucky them.
- How come you always ask Donna,

170
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,462
"Donna, by the way,

171
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,130
those are really nice shoes
that Louis has on"?

172
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,698
Gentlemen.

173
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,767
We're on the same side.

174
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:44,403
And although I would not choose
to have you both on this,

175
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,238
that is how it fell.

176
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:50,709
So I expect you to put
your differences aside

177
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,312
and work together on this

178
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,848
so that everyone
can be happy.

179
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:58,885
Can you manage that
this time?

180
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:04,825
She's always hated me.

181
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,061
Maybe this is a chance
to put all that behind you.

182
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:09,197
I'd like that.
Really, I would.

183
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:11,400
But Maddie?
I don't think so.

184
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:12,801
Maybe she'll surprise you.

185
00:07:12,836 --> 00:07:14,536
Kelsey's a bitch.

186
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,904
She doesn't deserve
any of it.

187
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:18,573
Well, I'm afraid your father
didn't share

188
00:07:18,608 --> 00:07:20,442
that point of view.

189
00:07:20,476 --> 00:07:23,178
According to his will,
we were meant...

190
00:07:23,212 --> 00:07:24,546
To find a division
of these companies

191
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,780
that makes both of you happy.

192
00:07:25,815 --> 00:07:26,781
But I want to make sure...

193
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:28,250
That you're happy.

194
00:07:28,284 --> 00:07:29,751
You want to know
what will make me happy?

195
00:07:29,786 --> 00:07:31,086
Whatever makes her miserable.

196
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,454
It's simple.

197
00:07:32,488 --> 00:07:34,390
I want <i>Nothing But the Truth.</i>

198
00:07:34,424 --> 00:07:36,992
My father and I worked together
on it for years, and...

199
00:07:37,027 --> 00:07:38,961
It made me crazy.

200
00:07:38,996 --> 00:07:41,831
The two of them pretending
that tabloid was literature.

201
00:07:41,865 --> 00:07:43,499
It means everything to me.

202
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:44,700
All I want...

203
00:07:44,735 --> 00:07:46,135
Is to sell off
that piece of garbage

204
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:48,103
and for her to get
as little as possible.

205
00:07:48,138 --> 00:07:49,638
What made her
so mad at you?

206
00:07:49,673 --> 00:07:51,940
She blames me for our dad
leaving her mother

207
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:53,175
and marrying mine.

208
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:55,476
How can she think
that's your fault?

209
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,145
Because her mother
got pregnant

210
00:07:57,179 --> 00:07:59,346
and used it to rope in
my dad.

211
00:07:59,381 --> 00:08:02,883
And then little Kelsey became
the center of his universe.

212
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:05,552
You know what it's like
to have someone hate you

213
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:06,853
out of pure jealousy?

214
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,188
We'll get you the paper.

215
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:10,423
Do you know what it's like

216
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:12,826
to watch someone else
get all the attention

217
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,296
when you know that you're twice
the person they are?

218
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,300
She's not getting that paper.

219
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:20,668
[Phones ringing]

220
00:08:20,702 --> 00:08:22,236
- Maddie.
- Kelsey.

221
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,738
- Louis.
- Harvey.

222
00:08:23,772 --> 00:08:25,607
Doctor, doctor.

223
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:27,643
- Chevy.
- Nice.

224
00:08:27,677 --> 00:08:28,777
Good meeting?

225
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:29,778
Yeah, we connected.
You?

226
00:08:29,813 --> 00:08:31,147
We're on the same page.

227
00:08:31,181 --> 00:08:33,883
Hm. What was, uh,
Kelsey looking for?

228
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:35,484
I don't know.
Why don't you ask Jenny?

229
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,521
You seem to like talking
to her.

230
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:42,692
[Keyboard clicking]

231
00:08:42,726 --> 00:08:45,160
No, Mike,
that's not distracting.

232
00:08:45,195 --> 00:08:46,462
I was just waiting.

233
00:08:46,496 --> 00:08:47,563
For what?

234
00:08:47,597 --> 00:08:51,034
To not be distracting.

235
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:52,669
How come Harvey doesn't talk
about working

236
00:08:52,703 --> 00:08:55,438
for the D.A.'s office?

237
00:08:55,473 --> 00:08:57,007
- Who told you that?
- Cameron Dennis.

238
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,843
We ran into him
this morning.

239
00:08:58,877 --> 00:09:00,445
They're having dinner.

240
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:02,180
So that's why he wouldn't tell
me where he was going.

241
00:09:02,214 --> 00:09:04,583
What's going on, Donna?

242
00:09:04,617 --> 00:09:05,617
Let it go.

243
00:09:05,652 --> 00:09:06,952
Don't ask Harvey about this.

244
00:09:06,986 --> 00:09:08,320
What's the big secret?

245
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:10,923
It's no secret.
Just...

246
00:09:10,957 --> 00:09:13,325
Don't.

247
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:15,460
And what are we talking about?

248
00:09:15,494 --> 00:09:16,728
The Price sisters.

249
00:09:16,762 --> 00:09:21,165
Those girls.

250
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:24,034
Mm.

251
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:25,736
Do we really have to play nice
with Louis?

252
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,770
I wanna crush him.

253
00:09:26,804 --> 00:09:27,871
You wanna crush him?

254
00:09:27,905 --> 00:09:29,239
Get over to the paper,

255
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:31,207
kick the tires,
and figure out what it's worth.

256
00:09:31,242 --> 00:09:32,442
I thought we were supposed
to use

257
00:09:32,477 --> 00:09:33,777
the independent valuations.

258
00:09:33,812 --> 00:09:35,079
What, you think he's gonna
play by the rules?

259
00:09:35,113 --> 00:09:36,446
I know he won't.

260
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:37,914
That's why you better be three
steps ahead of him,

261
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:39,049
because I can guarantee you

262
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,918
Louis'll be two steps
ahead of you.

263
00:09:40,952 --> 00:09:42,319
Speak of the devil,

264
00:09:42,353 --> 00:09:43,353
her majesty's here
to see you.

265
00:09:43,387 --> 00:09:44,454
- I heard that.
- You were meant to.

266
00:09:44,489 --> 00:09:46,457
- Gentlemen.
- Your highness.

267
00:09:46,491 --> 00:09:48,125
Okay, you know what?
That's exactly why I'm here.

268
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,894
To be mocked?

269
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:50,995
No, to set clear ground rules,

270
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,764
to keep the negotiation
above board.

271
00:09:52,798 --> 00:09:53,965
Absolutely.

272
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,433
No kicking, no biting,
and no rabbit punches.

273
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:56,501
And now you're mocking
the ground rules.

274
00:09:56,536 --> 00:09:57,903
No, I'm just mocking you.

275
00:09:57,937 --> 00:09:59,371
Point one.

276
00:09:59,406 --> 00:10:01,440
We both agree to use
the independent valuations.

277
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,242
Absolutely.
Good point.

278
00:10:03,277 --> 00:10:05,245
Point two.

279
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,280
You do not call Jessica in
to mediate.

280
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,749
This is you and me.

281
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:10,083
You afraid mom's gonna take
my side?

282
00:10:10,118 --> 00:10:11,752
No, I know mom's gonna take
your side.

283
00:10:11,786 --> 00:10:13,487
- Because I'd be right.
- Point three.

284
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:15,022
Chinese wall.

285
00:10:15,056 --> 00:10:17,157
You can't access any internal
documents that I create.

286
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:18,358
Let's make Jessica proud.

287
00:10:18,392 --> 00:10:19,860
We do this right,
everyone walks away happy.

288
00:10:19,894 --> 00:10:21,795
Wonderful.

289
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,363
Don't worry.
We'll still crush him.

290
00:10:23,397 --> 00:10:26,399
- I heard that.
- You were meant to.

291
00:10:31,038 --> 00:10:32,172
Care to make a wager?

292
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:34,007
Our job is to make
both sisters happy.

293
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,375
How do we know who wins?

294
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:37,377
Both: We'll know.

295
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:38,812
- Usual amount?
- No.

296
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,246
I think we should change it up
this time.

297
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:42,949
I win, I get Mike.

298
00:10:42,983 --> 00:10:45,218
You can't bet me
like I'm chattel, Louis.

299
00:10:45,252 --> 00:10:46,352
It's not like
he's gonna win.

300
00:10:46,387 --> 00:10:48,188
- One month.
- Ten days.

301
00:10:48,222 --> 00:10:49,489
- Harvey.
- Two weeks.

302
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,690
- Nine days.
- Harvey!

303
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:53,059
All right, you know what?
Fine. Ten days.

304
00:10:53,093 --> 00:10:54,961
And in return?

305
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:56,996
Well, that's tough
because anything you have

306
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,231
I wouldn't want.

307
00:10:59,265 --> 00:11:01,567
What? Uh, you're gonna bet me
for nothing?

308
00:11:15,848 --> 00:11:18,182
Harvey?

309
00:11:18,217 --> 00:11:20,618
Harvey Specter.

310
00:11:20,652 --> 00:11:22,018
Alexandra Leeds.

311
00:11:22,053 --> 00:11:23,119
I hear you're working

312
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:24,487
for the Attorney General's
office.

313
00:11:24,522 --> 00:11:26,056
And you're fighting
for the oppressive capitalists.

314
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,923
Winning
for the oppressive capitalists.

315
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,892
Oh, good for you.
We should have lunch.

316
00:11:29,926 --> 00:11:32,761
Catch up.

317
00:11:32,795 --> 00:11:34,830
Who told you
I was coming here tonight?

318
00:11:34,864 --> 00:11:37,032
No one.

319
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,267
I haven't seen you
in five years.

320
00:11:38,301 --> 00:11:39,267
You wanna catch up?

321
00:11:39,302 --> 00:11:40,902
You want something
from me,

322
00:11:40,936 --> 00:11:42,804
and it isn't lunch.

323
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,773
I want to talk
about Cameron Dennis.

324
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:47,876
Six feet, Pisces, wavy hair.

325
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:49,244
I'm serious.

326
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,281
I haven't worked for Cameron
in over a decade.

327
00:11:52,315 --> 00:11:53,615
What's there to talk about?

328
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,851
The Attorney General
is investigating allegations

329
00:11:55,885 --> 00:11:57,319
that he systematically
buried evidence

330
00:11:57,353 --> 00:11:58,921
to get convictions.

331
00:11:58,955 --> 00:12:01,723
So talk to people
who actually work with the guy.

332
00:12:01,758 --> 00:12:03,392
No, that's the problem.
He's still their boss.

333
00:12:03,426 --> 00:12:04,426
Nobody's talking.

334
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,861
Neither am I.

335
00:12:05,895 --> 00:12:07,262
Over lunch
or anywhere else.

336
00:12:07,297 --> 00:12:08,597
So best of luck.

338
00:12:11,301 --> 00:12:15,704
I was hoping
for some lunch.

339
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:17,306
I'm having you subpoenaed

340
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,974
to testify
before a grand jury.

341
00:12:19,008 --> 00:12:19,975
Enjoy your dinner.

342
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:23,011
Give Cameron my best.

343
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:34,402
Hey, Harvey.

344
00:12:34,436 --> 00:12:36,036
Glad you could make it.
How are you?

345
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:37,204
Tell me about
the bullshit run-in

346
00:12:37,238 --> 00:12:38,238
that you staged this morning.

347
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:39,573
How long did you have to wait

348
00:12:39,607 --> 00:12:42,608
so that you could pretend
to be surprised to see me?

349
00:12:42,643 --> 00:12:43,776
Ten minutes.

350
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,944
You're never early,

351
00:12:44,978 --> 00:12:46,145
but I didn't want to cut it
too close.

352
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:47,780
I also just had
another little run-in

353
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:50,148
with Alexandra Leeds.

354
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:52,484
You really want
to drag me into this?

355
00:12:52,518 --> 00:12:53,585
Calm down, Harvey.

356
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:56,021
I'm not dragging you
into anything.

357
00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:57,488
They're dragging me
into this.

358
00:12:57,523 --> 00:13:00,025
It's election year nonsense,
and I wanted to warn you.

359
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:02,093
So you asked me here
to warn me?

360
00:13:02,127 --> 00:13:06,164
Yeah, and to reassure myself
that you've got my back.

361
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:07,899
How bad is it?

362
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:09,067
It's nothing
I can't handle,

363
00:13:09,102 --> 00:13:10,569

Look, Harvey.

Whatever differences we had,

366
00:13:14,975 --> 00:13:16,375
we were a good team.

367
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:19,645
The truth is that...

368
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,480
if anything taints
the work that we did,

369
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:23,915
it'll be bad
for both of us.

370
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,517
Is that a threat?

371
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:27,786
Not at all.
It's just reality.

372
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,954
We put away bad people, Harvey.

373

always approve

of the means,

378
00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:38,996
but we both know
that the end result

379
00:13:39,031 --> 00:13:41,099
was always right.

Yes.

Okay, so there are
ten companies.

467
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,866
We propose that Kelsey takes

468

companies one, three,
seven, and nine.

469
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:05,439
So that gives us...

470
00:17:05,473 --> 00:17:07,208
52.3% of the assets.

471
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:10,110
Hm, generous, but no.

472
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:12,280
Uh, alternatively,

473
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:14,282
we propose that Kelsey takes

474
00:17:14,316 --> 00:17:16,851
companies one, two,
four, and eight.

475
00:17:16,886 --> 00:17:17,886
That gives you--

54.6%.

477
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,989
No.

478
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:22,324

a counterproposal, or--

479
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:24,160
No.

480
00:17:24,194 --> 00:17:27,363
Okay, uh, Kelsey takes
companies one, seven,

481
00:17:27,398 --> 00:17:29,432
eight, and nine.
No.

482
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,501

of the assets.

483
00:17:31,535 --> 00:17:35,005
Yes.
But no.

484
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,276
What is it
your client wants?

485
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,945
Well, your offer
makes it infinitely clear

486

487
00:17:43,347 --> 00:17:44,948
The tabloid.

488
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:47,416
And what my client wants
is for your client

489
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:48,617
to not get what she wants,

490
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,653
so you can't have
the tabloid, period.

491
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:53,288

to take these offers

00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,322
to your client.

493
00:17:54,357 --> 00:17:55,624
So bring me up
on ethics charges.

494
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,926
Or report me
to your supervisor.

495
00:17:57,961 --> 00:18:00,595
Oh, wait, shit.
I am your supervisor.

496
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,632
Hold on one second.

497
00:18:06,469 --> 00:18:08,705
Go ahead.

498
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:09,873
What are your complaints?

499
00:18:09,907 --> 00:18:11,908
Have any? No? Really?

500
00:18:16,781 --> 00:18:17,848
We're supposed to find

501
00:18:17,882 --> 00:18:19,149
a fair and equitable settlement,
Louis.

502
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:21,151
Okay, you go run
and tell Jessica.

503
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:22,820
Oh, wait, that would be
breaking the rules,

504
00:18:22,855 --> 00:18:24,522
and then you've have to come
work for me.

505
00:18:24,556 --> 00:18:26,057
So why don't you run along now
and get Harvey

506
00:18:26,091 --> 00:18:27,625
and tell him
to get off his ass

507
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,261
and join the negotiations.

508
00:18:29,295 --> 00:18:32,264
Because you just failed.

509
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:35,100
When you left
the D.A.'s office,

510
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,368
you said you were done,

511
00:18:36,403 --> 00:18:37,369
you had learned enough,

512
00:18:37,404 --> 00:18:39,071
and that you were ready
to move on.

513
00:18:39,105 --> 00:18:40,839
Was that just bullshit?

514
00:18:40,873 --> 00:18:42,574
You were the one who wanted me
to have trial experience.

515
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:43,876
You said that Cameron
was the only one

516
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:44,943
that I should learn from.

517
00:18:44,978 --> 00:18:46,511
And what exactly
did he teach you?

518
00:18:46,546 --> 00:18:50,549
Harvey, why did you leave?

519
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,883
He had a case.

520
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:54,585
I caught him burying
a key piece of evidence

521
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,387
he was obligated
to turn over.

522
00:18:56,422 --> 00:18:57,588
The guy was guilty.

523
00:18:57,623 --> 00:19:00,391
The defense would've used it
to let him walk.

524
00:19:00,425 --> 00:19:02,126
All right, what kind
of exposure do you have?

525
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,427
I told him no,
but he didn't listen.

526
00:19:03,462 --> 00:19:04,795
Then you were obligated
to report him.

527
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,264
Which is why I left.

528
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:07,765
Why didn't you tell me this
at the time?

529
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:08,900
Because you put me there,
Jessica,

530
00:19:08,934 --> 00:19:09,901
to be mentored.

531
00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:11,702
Okay? And it occurred to me,

532
00:19:11,737 --> 00:19:15,206
that might've been exactly
what you wanted me to learn.

533
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,210
For the record,
it wasn't.

534
00:19:19,244 --> 00:19:20,745
I'm gonna represent you
at this deposition.

535
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:25,650
I'm gonna try to keep you
from talking.

536
00:19:25,684 --> 00:19:28,920
But I think you should.

537
00:19:28,954 --> 00:19:29,921
He was my mentor.

538
00:19:29,955 --> 00:19:31,389
He is a public servant.

539
00:19:31,423 --> 00:19:32,423
He was my mentor.

540
00:19:32,457 --> 00:19:33,924
The standards are higher.

541
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,425
He was my mentor.

542
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,728
And I am not gonna be
the one to expose him,

543
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:39,963
any more than I'd ever turn
on you.

544
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,115
Worst dating story--
identical twins.

545
00:19:54,116 --> 00:19:56,017
I was a lab rat
for their social experiment.

546
00:19:56,052 --> 00:19:58,119
They were trying to prove
that women were shallow

547
00:19:58,153 --> 00:19:59,787
and can't see
beyond the surface.

548
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:00,888
And they wanted to get laid.

549
00:20:00,923 --> 00:20:02,757
Yes, that too.

550
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,259
Good times.

551
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:06,561
So you slept with them both.

552
00:20:06,595 --> 00:20:07,963
Almost.

553
00:20:07,997 --> 00:20:11,133
Turns out they weren't identical
after all.

554
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:12,701
Wow.

555
00:20:12,736 --> 00:20:14,970
Excuse me, I am just going
to run to the ladies' room.

556
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,105
Oh, I'll go with you.

557
00:20:16,139 --> 00:20:19,141
Okay.

558
00:20:23,547 --> 00:20:24,914
What's wrong, Mikey?

559
00:20:24,948 --> 00:20:26,282
Tough day at the office?

560
00:20:26,316 --> 00:20:28,083
Didn't see you.
It could've been worse.

561
00:20:28,118 --> 00:20:29,084
That's good.

562
00:20:29,118 --> 00:20:30,685
So you and Rachel.

563
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,487
How long have you guys
been dating?

564
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:34,723
You know how lawyers
and clients work close

565
00:20:34,757 --> 00:20:36,524
over the course of a trial.

566
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,760
When we kicked your ass
in the mock trial,

567
00:20:38,794 --> 00:20:41,929
we, uh, bonded.

568
00:20:41,963 --> 00:20:43,197
You know
in the real world

569
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:45,800
dating clients is a violation
of ethics, right?

570
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:47,969
Good thing it's not
the real world.

571
00:20:48,003 --> 00:20:50,237
'Cause I intend to violate
those ethics

572
00:20:50,272 --> 00:20:52,239
all night.

573
00:20:52,274 --> 00:20:54,476
You know the funny thing?

574
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,979
I always thought
you'd get there first.

575
00:20:57,013 --> 00:20:58,814
I'll tell you how she is.

576
00:20:58,849 --> 00:20:59,916
Shut up, Kyle.

577
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,550
Someone might think
you're jealous.

578
00:21:01,585 --> 00:21:02,785
Someone might think
you're a dick.

579
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,488
Oh, wait.
Somebody already does.

580
00:21:05,522 --> 00:21:07,189
That's good.
You should write that one down.

581
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,357
Do you keep a journal
of these things?

582
00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:09,358
Finish your tofu.

583
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:10,659
So how did you two meet?

584
00:21:10,693 --> 00:21:13,629
Um...

585
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:17,332
I dated his best friend.

586
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:18,600
I know, it's awful.

587
00:21:18,635 --> 00:21:23,205
But he was a bad guy,
and I didn't see it.

588
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:25,540
Mike showed me.

589
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:26,675
The truth is, I--

590
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:29,177
I think there was always
something there with us.

591
00:21:29,212 --> 00:21:31,947
But nothing happened until
Trevor and I were totally done.

592
00:21:31,981 --> 00:21:34,617
Never?

593
00:21:34,651 --> 00:21:38,087
Well, we did kiss once.

594
00:21:43,027 --> 00:21:43,994
Hey, having fun?

595
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:45,162
Loads.
Right, Mike?

596
00:21:45,196 --> 00:21:46,697
I think we're gonna go.

597
00:21:46,731 --> 00:21:48,065
What? No.
We're having fun.

598
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,400
Come on, you don't want
to ruin this.

599
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:51,002
- Yeah.
- Kyle, really, just--

600
00:21:51,037 --> 00:21:52,771
okay, Kyle, just--

601
00:21:52,805 --> 00:21:53,805
What? What's the problem?

602
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:57,343
Stop it.
She doesn't like it.

603
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:08,186
God, that guy is such a tool.

604
00:22:08,221 --> 00:22:10,255
So what?
He's not your date.

605
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:11,589
Yeah, well,
I have to work with him.

606
00:22:11,624 --> 00:22:12,924
That's not why
it bothers you.

607
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,559
He's with Rachel,
and you know it.

608
00:22:14,593 --> 00:22:16,494
Oh, my God, Jenny.
We have been over this.

609
00:22:16,528 --> 00:22:18,996
I've seen the way
you look at her.

610
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,433
I've seen it before.

611
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:23,968
It's the way
you used to look at me

612
00:22:24,002 --> 00:22:25,036
when I was with Trevor.

613
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,604
Jenny--

614
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:28,673
I'm going home, Mike.

615
00:22:28,707 --> 00:22:30,842
Decide what you want.

616
00:22:30,877 --> 00:22:34,380
In or out.

617
00:22:34,414 --> 00:22:36,316
I like you.

618
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:39,352
A lot.

619
00:22:39,387 --> 00:22:41,388
But you can't have both.

620
00:22:49,731 --> 00:22:51,865
I worked as an assistant
district attorney

621
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:53,366
for the county of New York
for two years.

622
00:22:53,401 --> 00:22:54,968
Tell me about your
relationship

623
00:22:55,003 --> 00:22:55,969
with Cameron Dennis.

624
00:22:56,004 --> 00:22:57,471
Vague.

625
00:22:57,505 --> 00:23:00,941
Did you and district attorney
Cameron Dennis

626
00:23:00,975 --> 00:23:02,909
work closely together?

627
00:23:02,943 --> 00:23:05,579
He was my boss.
He supervised all my cases.

628
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:07,414
And were you personally close?

629
00:23:07,448 --> 00:23:09,449
- Subjective.
- A judge would allow it.

630
00:23:09,483 --> 00:23:12,752
And yet there's
not one here.

631
00:23:12,787 --> 00:23:14,688
Do you really think
by deposing him on the stand

632
00:23:14,722 --> 00:23:16,290
you're going to intimidate him?

633
00:23:16,324 --> 00:23:17,958
I think deposing him here
will let him know

634
00:23:17,992 --> 00:23:19,960
what it will be like
if this evidence

635
00:23:19,994 --> 00:23:21,394
is brought forward at trial.

636
00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:23,229
You're not getting
to trial.

637
00:23:23,264 --> 00:23:25,165
If your client doesn't
perjure himself right now,

638
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:27,233
I won't have to.

639
00:23:27,267 --> 00:23:30,669
Were you and Cameron Dennis
close personally?

640
00:23:30,704 --> 00:23:32,571
He was my mentor.

641
00:23:32,605 --> 00:23:34,005
It's a hard relationship
to define.

642
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,240
Moving on, counselor.

643
00:23:35,274 --> 00:23:36,441
All right.

644
00:23:36,476 --> 00:23:40,211
We don't have to talk
about Mr. Dennis.

645
00:23:40,246 --> 00:23:42,947
Let's talk about you,
Mr. Specter.

646
00:23:42,982 --> 00:23:47,586
In two years,
you handled 18,362 cases.

647
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,188
36 cases a day.

648
00:23:49,222 --> 00:23:50,689
That's beyond impressive.

649
00:23:50,724 --> 00:23:52,758
Thank you.

650
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:55,461
You took 147 to trial,
winning them all.

651
00:23:55,495 --> 00:23:57,730
Don't go to trial
if you're not gonna win.

652
00:23:57,764 --> 00:23:59,265
Why'd you leave?

653
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:01,901
An attorney by the name
of Jessica Pearson

654
00:24:01,935 --> 00:24:03,202
helped me get
through law school,

655
00:24:03,236 --> 00:24:06,538
and she felt that I could use
trial experience.

656
00:24:06,573 --> 00:24:11,309
But I always planned
on ending up at her firm

657
00:24:11,344 --> 00:24:13,678
and paying her back
by earning that firm

658
00:24:13,713 --> 00:24:15,113
outrageous settlements.

659
00:24:15,147 --> 00:24:16,348
How am I doing?

660
00:24:16,382 --> 00:24:18,183
You could do better.

661
00:24:18,217 --> 00:24:19,851
You two think
that this is a joke.

662
00:24:19,885 --> 00:24:21,286
Argumentative.

663
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,021
You're damn right
it's argumentative.

664
00:24:23,056 --> 00:24:24,490
Because he knows
that laws have been broken,

665
00:24:24,524 --> 00:24:26,191
and he has an obligation
to report it.

666
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:27,359
Ms. Leeds--

667
00:24:27,393 --> 00:24:28,861
But if this is the way
you want to play it,

668
00:24:28,895 --> 00:24:30,129
the Attorney General
has given me

669
00:24:30,163 --> 00:24:32,665
a broad mandate to uncover
what went on.

670
00:24:32,699 --> 00:24:35,468
And it need not be limited
to Mr. Dennis.

671
00:24:35,503 --> 00:24:38,038
Were you part of the problem,
Mr. Specter?

672
00:24:38,073 --> 00:24:39,039
Vague.

673
00:24:39,074 --> 00:24:40,941
I'll rephrase.

674
00:24:40,976 --> 00:24:43,477
In your capacity
as assistant district attorney

675
00:24:43,512 --> 00:24:45,012
in the county of New York,

676
00:24:45,046 --> 00:24:47,147
did you knowingly
suppress evidence

677
00:24:47,182 --> 00:24:48,815
in violation
of the A.V.A. Rules of Conduct,

678
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,417
the N.D.A.A. Standards,

679
00:24:50,451 --> 00:24:54,687
and the New York State Bar
Rule 8.4, section c?

680
00:24:54,721 --> 00:24:55,888
My client would like
to exercise

681
00:24:55,922 --> 00:24:58,990
his fifth amendment rights
at this time.

682
00:25:04,697 --> 00:25:05,864
I hear you botched
a settlement

683
00:25:05,898 --> 00:25:07,299
by negotiating against yourself.

684
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,101
I didn't--

685
00:25:09,135 --> 00:25:10,736
You let Louis know
the one thing

686
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,138
that was most important
to our client.

687
00:25:12,172 --> 00:25:13,139
Okay, yes,
I made a mistake.

688
00:25:13,173 --> 00:25:14,707
But Louis made one too.

689
00:25:14,741 --> 00:25:15,842
Well, he didn't mention that.

690
00:25:15,876 --> 00:25:17,477
Yes, he knows
what our client wants,

691
00:25:17,511 --> 00:25:19,212
but now we know the one thing
his client wants.

692
00:25:19,247 --> 00:25:21,215
She doesn't care
about winning, Harvey.

693
00:25:21,249 --> 00:25:23,584
She just wants our client
to lose.

694
00:25:23,618 --> 00:25:26,153
Okay, well, that's good.
So what's next?

695
00:25:26,188 --> 00:25:27,154
We lose.

696
00:25:27,189 --> 00:25:28,389
We give her the tabloid.

697
00:25:28,423 --> 00:25:29,890
Well, how does that make
our client happy?

698
00:25:29,925 --> 00:25:31,192
We let Madison have
the paper,

699
00:25:31,226 --> 00:25:32,926
and then we take
everyone who works there,

700
00:25:32,961 --> 00:25:34,428
and we start a new one.

701
00:25:34,462 --> 00:25:36,229
They all love Kelsey.

702
00:25:36,264 --> 00:25:37,731
<i>Nothing But the Truth</i>
is just a name.

703
00:25:37,765 --> 00:25:38,832
We let Madison have it.

704
00:25:38,866 --> 00:25:41,735
I have taught you
a thing or two.

705
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:44,271
Well, I see that you're
up to speed.

706
00:25:44,305 --> 00:25:45,572
Well, as am I.

707
00:25:45,606 --> 00:25:47,240
Um, I noticed that there were
some employee issues

708
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:48,308
at the tabloid.

709
00:25:48,342 --> 00:25:49,509
You know,
contracts about to expire.

710
00:25:49,544 --> 00:25:51,345
So I just want
to let you guys know

711
00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:54,482
that I went ahead and locked up
all the key employees.

712
00:25:54,516 --> 00:25:56,083
Just to protect us.

713
00:25:56,117 --> 00:25:59,920
Since we're all working on this
together, right?

714
00:25:59,954 --> 00:26:01,989
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

715
00:26:05,192 --> 00:26:06,159
- He knows.
- He can't.

716
00:26:06,194 --> 00:26:08,161
- He does.
- I was careful.

717
00:26:08,196 --> 00:26:09,830
I deleted every file
from the server.

718
00:26:09,865 --> 00:26:12,132
The only time any paper trail
left my locked desk

719
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:13,300
is when I faxed it
to Kelsey.

720
00:26:13,334 --> 00:26:14,801
Oh, you faxed it.

721
00:26:14,836 --> 00:26:16,336
From the large machine

722
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:17,938
that stores all the information
you put in it

723
00:26:17,972 --> 00:26:20,140
to be printed back later
by anyone who has your code?

724
00:26:20,174 --> 00:26:21,141
He can't do that.

725
00:26:21,175 --> 00:26:23,176
We have a Chinese wall thingy.

726
00:26:23,211 --> 00:26:24,611
Oh, God, he's gonna beat us,
isn't he?

727
00:26:24,645 --> 00:26:26,580
Look, he knows what
we're up to,

728
00:26:26,614 --> 00:26:28,815
but he couldn't keep his tactics
to himself.

729
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:29,984
So we can use that
against him.

730
00:26:30,018 --> 00:26:32,420
And that's how
we'll crush Louis.

731
00:26:32,454 --> 00:26:34,121
Refresher course, Harvey.

732
00:26:34,155 --> 00:26:36,123
You and Louis
aren't opponents on this one.

733
00:26:36,157 --> 00:26:37,291
You're working together.

734
00:26:37,325 --> 00:26:39,026
Like Captain & Tennille?

735
00:26:39,061 --> 00:26:40,995
Well, if so, he's Tennille.

736
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:44,432
Who?

737
00:26:44,466 --> 00:26:46,400
You need to come with me.

738
00:26:46,434 --> 00:26:47,501
What, am I in trouble?

739
00:26:47,536 --> 00:26:50,537
Yeah, Harvey.
You are.

740
00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:02,247
Gonna buy me a drink
before you screw me?

741
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:03,381
Sit down, Harvey.

742
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:06,952
Listen to what she has
to say.

743
00:27:06,986 --> 00:27:11,290
You got me trembling
in my boots.

744
00:27:11,324 --> 00:27:12,491
You're a small fish,

745
00:27:12,525 --> 00:27:14,326
and you don't even swim
in the pond anymore.

746
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,361
But if I have to eat you alive
to get to Cameron Dennis,

747
00:27:16,395 --> 00:27:19,297
I will.

748
00:27:19,331 --> 00:27:20,298
This is my case against him.

749
00:27:20,332 --> 00:27:22,567
Falsifying DNA tests,

750
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:24,169
coerced confessions,

751
00:27:24,203 --> 00:27:26,204
testimony buried.

752
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:29,407
You have all this.
Why do you need me?

753
00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:31,710
Because this is circumstantial.

754
00:27:31,744 --> 00:27:33,045
You have the crimes,

755
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,413
but you can't physically tie
them to Cameron.

756
00:27:34,447 --> 00:27:35,848
He's a dirty public servant,

757
00:27:35,882 --> 00:27:38,384
and I think
it's why you left.

758
00:27:38,418 --> 00:27:40,386
Your record was too good
to just walk away.

759
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,487
Maybe I got greedy.

760
00:27:41,522 --> 00:27:43,122
- Harvey.
- I'm not testifying.

761
00:27:43,157 --> 00:27:44,157
You're being stubborn.

762
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:45,191
And this isn't one

763
00:27:45,226 --> 00:27:47,893
where you get to make
the call.

764
00:27:47,927 --> 00:27:50,629
I'm sorry.

765
00:27:50,663 --> 00:27:52,597
I've done all I can.

766
00:27:52,632 --> 00:27:55,833
It wasn't just his cases
he cheated on.

767
00:27:55,868 --> 00:27:57,368
Hector Avila.

768
00:27:57,402 --> 00:27:58,569
Take a look.

769
00:27:58,603 --> 00:28:00,538
You think you were really
that great?

770
00:28:00,572 --> 00:28:02,139
You think your
great track record

771
00:28:02,174 --> 00:28:04,075
was because of your skill?

772
00:28:04,109 --> 00:28:07,512
I got two theories here, Harvey.

773
00:28:07,546 --> 00:28:09,080
Either you're wasting your time
protecting a man

774
00:28:09,115 --> 00:28:10,448
who screwed you
from the beginning,

775
00:28:10,483 --> 00:28:13,051
or you didn't just know
he did this.

776
00:28:13,086 --> 00:28:14,219
You participated.

777
00:28:14,254 --> 00:28:17,256
In which case
I'll have you disbarred.

778
00:28:26,068 --> 00:28:27,402
Come on.
Come on.

779
00:28:27,436 --> 00:28:29,604
Damn it.

780
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:30,605
What are you doing?

781
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,907
Uh, nothing.

782
00:28:31,941 --> 00:28:35,344
I'm just sending
some faxes.

783
00:28:35,378 --> 00:28:37,813
Stand down.

784
00:28:37,847 --> 00:28:39,181
They're stuck, Donna.

785
00:28:39,216 --> 00:28:40,415
What are you gonna do?

786
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,351
[Whispering]
I'm the fax whisperer.

787
00:28:43,386 --> 00:28:45,453
Okay, that's ridiculous,
all right?

788
00:28:45,488 --> 00:28:46,588
I've tried everything.

789
00:28:46,622 --> 00:28:47,856
I've hit--
I've already done that.

790
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:50,625
And it didn't--

791
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:52,293
whatever.

792
00:28:52,327 --> 00:28:54,296
United International
wants to buy the tabloid?

793
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,831
Uh, whatever you do,
don't say anything to Louis.

794
00:28:56,866 --> 00:28:58,700
Kelsey Price
does not want to sell.

795
00:28:58,735 --> 00:29:00,136
Not a word.

796
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:03,172
Thanks.

797
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,323
Whoa.
Something explode in here?

798
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,658
Just doing some research.

799
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:25,962
Yeah, 'cause you always do
your own research.

800
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,231
Okay, closed-door meeting
with Donna,

801
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,166
with Jessica.

802
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:33,436
Dinner with some D.A. you've
never even mentioned before.

803
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,439
Is this all something
Cameron Dennis taught you?

804
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,108
Keep secrets from everyone
because you're so good,

805
00:29:38,142 --> 00:29:39,410
you don't need
anyone's help?

806
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,212
There's an investigation
into evidence tampering.

807
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:46,685
I've been asked to testify
against my old boss...

808
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:49,922
or face charges myself.

809
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:53,392
You could be disbarred.

810
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:56,562
If I'm found guilty.

811
00:29:56,596 --> 00:29:58,464
Are you guilty?

812
00:29:58,498 --> 00:30:00,065
Not of evidence tampering.

813
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,300
I would never do that.

814
00:30:01,334 --> 00:30:02,534
Of anything else?

815
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:03,769
Anything I ever did,

816
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,504
you put me in front
of an unbiased judge,

817
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:06,872
I walk away clean.

818
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:08,874
You put me in a courtroom
with a grand jury,

819
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:11,477
anything can happen.

820
00:30:11,511 --> 00:30:13,579
So are you gonna testify?

821
00:30:13,613 --> 00:30:15,248
I'm not sure
what choice I have.

822
00:30:15,282 --> 00:30:18,352
Well, some dickhead
once told me

823
00:30:18,386 --> 00:30:21,255
that when they put a gun
to your head,

824
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:23,458
it's not just give in
or be killed.

825
00:30:23,492 --> 00:30:28,096
There are 146 other options.

826
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,664
You'll figure something out.

827
00:30:29,699 --> 00:30:32,134
[Knock at door]

828
00:30:32,168 --> 00:30:33,935
I'll have a proposal for you
in the morning,

829
00:30:33,969 --> 00:30:35,503
and I think
we'll all be happy.

830
00:30:35,538 --> 00:30:37,238
All right?

831
00:30:37,272 --> 00:30:40,408
Night.

832
00:30:40,442 --> 00:30:42,543
He took the bait?

833
00:30:42,577 --> 00:30:44,277
Like shooting a fish
in a barrel.

834
00:30:44,312 --> 00:30:47,313
Good work.

835
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,783
Where you going?

836
00:30:50,817 --> 00:30:53,819
I just might take
your advice.

837
00:31:13,407 --> 00:31:14,374
The tides are turning.

838
00:31:14,408 --> 00:31:16,676
You turning with them,
Harvey?

839
00:31:16,711 --> 00:31:18,178
They turn you?

840
00:31:18,213 --> 00:31:21,782
Hector Avila.

841
00:31:21,817 --> 00:31:22,983
You don't even know,
do you?

842
00:31:23,018 --> 00:31:24,785
Is this some old case?

843
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,621
It's my old case,
and you buried evidence.

844
00:31:27,656 --> 00:31:30,891
You wearing a wire,
Harvey?

845
00:31:30,926 --> 00:31:33,494
No, you're not.

846
00:31:33,528 --> 00:31:34,895
I can tell.

847
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:37,130
I'm not that easy to read
anymore, Cameron.

848
00:31:37,165 --> 00:31:38,632
You are to me.

849
00:31:38,666 --> 00:31:39,899
Hector Avila.

850
00:31:39,934 --> 00:31:41,668
Was he guilty,
whoever he was?

851
00:31:41,702 --> 00:31:43,536
- He was my case.
- Guilty is guilty.

852
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,903
That's not the way
the system works.

853
00:31:44,938 --> 00:31:46,638
The system is broken,
and you know it.

854
00:31:46,673 --> 00:31:48,006
It's not reasonable doubt.

855
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:50,575
Juries want to be sure
without a shadow of a doubt.

856
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,944
It was my case.

857
00:31:51,978 --> 00:31:53,212
You worked for me.

858
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:56,983
They were all my cases.

859
00:31:57,018 --> 00:31:57,984
You're a disappointment.

860
00:31:58,019 --> 00:31:59,286
No.

861
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,988
You're the disappointment.

862
00:32:01,022 --> 00:32:02,556
You could've been D.A. yourself.

863
00:32:02,591 --> 00:32:04,625
You are twice the lawyer
than any of the pricks lined up

864
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,693
to run against me.

865
00:32:05,727 --> 00:32:06,861
But you sold out.

866
00:32:06,895 --> 00:32:08,229
You help rich people
keep their money.

867
00:32:08,264 --> 00:32:09,397
That's all you do.

868
00:32:09,431 --> 00:32:12,300
I stack my value to society
against yours,

869
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:15,335
and I win by a mile.

870
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:18,838
So you're selling me out?

871
00:32:18,873 --> 00:32:20,540
We both know they don't want
to put you in jail.

872
00:32:20,574 --> 00:32:22,542
That's not what this
is about.

873
00:32:22,576 --> 00:32:25,310
Walk away, Cameron.
Make a deal.

874
00:32:25,345 --> 00:32:27,246
Let someone else be D.A.,
and all of this,

875
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,513
it goes away.

876
00:32:28,548 --> 00:32:29,614
Otherwise?

877
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:31,583
You know what happens
if you talk.

878
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:33,385
They start reopening cases.

879
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,054
Maybe Hector Avila
walks away.

880
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:36,856
He murdered once.
He'll murder again.

881
00:32:36,891 --> 00:32:38,525
You do remember him
don't you?

882
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,593
Oh, I remember 'em all.

883
00:32:39,627 --> 00:32:40,760
Maxwell Rankin?

884
00:32:40,795 --> 00:32:44,231
What was it, uh,
34 or 35 women that he raped?

885
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:46,100
Alberto Plank?
You remember him?

886
00:32:46,134 --> 00:32:48,136
He burned his children alive.

887
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,437
You'll open the floodgates,
Harvey.

888
00:32:49,472 --> 00:32:50,639
Do you want that
on your conscience?

889
00:32:50,673 --> 00:32:52,640
Then make a deal.

890
00:32:52,675 --> 00:32:55,643
It's on you
to keep them in jail.

891
00:32:55,677 --> 00:32:59,879
Okay.

892
00:32:59,914 --> 00:33:03,149
Okay, Harvey.

893
00:33:03,183 --> 00:33:04,250
You win.

894
00:33:04,284 --> 00:33:08,387
This isn't winning.

895
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:09,721
Good to see you, Harvey.

896
00:33:09,756 --> 00:33:12,757
Let's do it again soon.

897
00:33:17,514 --> 00:33:19,282
So your client's really
willing to give Madison

898
00:33:19,316 --> 00:33:20,884
<i>Nothing But the Truth?</i>

899
00:33:20,918 --> 00:33:22,753
You made it clear
it was non-negotiable.

900
00:33:22,787 --> 00:33:26,123
I convinced my client
to settle.

901
00:33:26,157 --> 00:33:27,624
She wants to move on.

902
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:28,959
You're sure
there isn't anything

903
00:33:28,993 --> 00:33:31,694
that you want to, uh,
disclose?

904
00:33:31,729 --> 00:33:33,796
Nope.

905
00:33:33,831 --> 00:33:36,999
I think we're good.

906
00:33:37,034 --> 00:33:40,035
Then we're good.

907
00:33:42,405 --> 00:33:43,639
Everybody's happy.

908
00:33:43,673 --> 00:33:46,141
Mm-hmm.

909
00:33:46,176 --> 00:33:49,178
As clams.

910
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:53,818
Thank you, Louis.

911
00:33:53,852 --> 00:33:56,554
You, um...

912
00:33:56,588 --> 00:33:57,855
Happy with the deal?

913
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,557
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
I am.

914
00:33:59,591 --> 00:34:01,993
You?

915
00:34:02,027 --> 00:34:05,229
[Chuckles]

916
00:34:05,264 --> 00:34:07,265
You don't even know
the half of it.

917
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:08,633
Don't I?

918
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:10,568
Are you happy that your client
got the paper

919
00:34:10,602 --> 00:34:14,505
or that you turned around
and sold it?

920
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,976
Oh, you didn't think I knew
about that, did you?

921
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:20,579
Want to know why
I'm happy, Louis?

922
00:34:20,613 --> 00:34:23,114
I'm happy because when you read
over that offer

923
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:24,817
from United International,

924
00:34:24,851 --> 00:34:27,219
I wanted you to read that.

925
00:34:27,253 --> 00:34:29,255
I wanted you to sell
to them.

926
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:31,390
Because the thing
you didn't know

927
00:34:31,424 --> 00:34:36,762
is that yesterday Kelsey Price
bought United International.

928
00:34:36,796 --> 00:34:39,197
You shouldn't go
behind people's backs, Louis.

929
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,066
You shouldn't try
and access information

930
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,168
that's none of your business.

931
00:34:43,202 --> 00:34:44,636
It could backfire.

932
00:34:44,671 --> 00:34:47,707
Mm.

933
00:34:50,577 --> 00:34:54,147
I think we need to talk
to Harvey.

934
00:34:54,181 --> 00:34:55,282
I'm sorry, Harvey.

935
00:34:55,316 --> 00:34:56,350
You set me up.

936
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,619
No, Louis.
You set yourself up.

937
00:34:58,653 --> 00:35:00,955
The sales offer
was meaningless

938
00:35:00,989 --> 00:35:02,457
until you read it.

939
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:05,126
This is cheating.

940
00:35:05,161 --> 00:35:06,628
You cheated, Louis.

941
00:35:06,662 --> 00:35:09,598
You broke the rules,
and you have to pay the price.

942
00:35:09,632 --> 00:35:12,334
People may think that lawyers
will do anything,

943
00:35:12,368 --> 00:35:13,702
that they can do anything.

944
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,804
Now, I'm not willing
to accept that, okay?

945
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:17,706
You can't go skirting
the rules

946
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,507
and justify it
because you think someone else

947
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:20,642
broke the rules, okay?

948
00:35:20,676 --> 00:35:22,344
You cheated!

949
00:35:22,378 --> 00:35:23,745
And you lost!

950
00:35:23,779 --> 00:35:25,947
End of story.

951
00:35:32,188 --> 00:35:37,025
Harvey, I won.

952
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:40,296
His play acting
by the fax machine

953
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:41,464
was so obvious.

954
00:35:41,498 --> 00:35:43,700
I found out Kelsey owned
United International,

955
00:35:43,734 --> 00:35:45,435
and I thought if they wanted
the paper so badly,

956
00:35:45,469 --> 00:35:47,904
how much would they overpay
for it?

957
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:51,073
50%.

958
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:53,008
Harvey, you overpaid 50%
for a business

959
00:35:53,042 --> 00:35:54,009
so buried in expenses

960
00:35:54,043 --> 00:35:56,378
from the employee deals
that I made,

961
00:35:56,412 --> 00:35:57,979
it can barely stay afloat.

962
00:35:58,014 --> 00:36:00,048
And then all I had to do
was convince Madison

963
00:36:00,082 --> 00:36:03,151
to sit back, have fun,
watch her sister fail miserably.

964
00:36:03,185 --> 00:36:04,419
I won.

965
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:07,022
Your client got
what she wanted.

966
00:36:07,056 --> 00:36:08,090
So did ours.

967
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,224
Jessica asked to make
everyone happy.

968
00:36:09,259 --> 00:36:13,363
Everyone's happy.
It's a draw.

969
00:36:13,397 --> 00:36:14,865
Just hold on a second.

970
00:36:14,899 --> 00:36:17,434
You tell me the truth
right now.

971
00:36:17,468 --> 00:36:18,936
Is this a win to you?

972
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,671
Fine, Louis.
You win.

973
00:36:20,706 --> 00:36:22,340
You were a step ahead.
You got Mike.

974
00:36:22,374 --> 00:36:23,341
Ten days.

975
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:26,812
You think I'd want him now?

976
00:36:26,846 --> 00:36:31,516
I just wiped the floor
with him.

977
00:36:31,551 --> 00:36:34,553
You can keep him.

978
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:43,295
How can I help you?

979
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,530
I'm not gonna let him
take the fall

980
00:36:44,564 --> 00:36:47,333
for that asshole.

981
00:36:47,368 --> 00:36:49,369
Have a seat.

982
00:36:54,809 --> 00:36:56,877
Harvey didn't see it
for a long time.

983
00:36:56,912 --> 00:36:59,413
I mean, Cameron's good
when he wants to be.

984
00:36:59,448 --> 00:37:02,083
You know how I judge
a man's character?

985
00:37:02,117 --> 00:37:03,952
Not by how he treats
his equals,

986
00:37:03,986 --> 00:37:07,455
but by how he treats
the underlings.

987
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:10,459
Lowest rungs on the ladder.

988
00:37:10,493 --> 00:37:14,096
You always impressed me
in that regard.

989
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:17,099
Thank you.

990
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:18,800
Harvey would never use this,

991
00:37:18,835 --> 00:37:20,835
and he'd kill me
if he knew I had it.

992
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:24,105
But can you help him?

993
00:37:24,139 --> 00:37:27,141
Can you use this
to help him?

994
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,392
Is Harvey punishing you
for something?

995
00:37:43,426 --> 00:37:45,160
Louis.

996
00:37:45,195 --> 00:37:46,261
No! You lost?

997
00:37:46,296 --> 00:37:47,562
You have to work for him?

998
00:37:47,597 --> 00:37:50,365
I lost, and then he said
he didn't want me.

999
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:51,366
He farmed me out.

1000
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,600
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1001
00:37:52,635 --> 00:37:57,539
Is there anything I can do
to help?

1002
00:37:57,573 --> 00:38:00,608
What?

1003
00:38:00,643 --> 00:38:02,277
That.

1004
00:38:02,311 --> 00:38:05,313
What are you talking about?

1005
00:38:09,251 --> 00:38:10,284
I wanted you for months.

1006
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:12,353
Rachel, I flirted.

1007
00:38:12,387 --> 00:38:14,655
I-I-I made up some scheme
where we were married.

1008
00:38:14,689 --> 00:38:16,223
And you made it clear

1009
00:38:16,258 --> 00:38:19,160
you don't date anyone
from the office.

1010
00:38:19,194 --> 00:38:20,428
Until I start seeing
someone else.

1011
00:38:20,462 --> 00:38:21,996
Okay, you're delusional.

1012
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:24,098
Why did you bring Kyle
on that date?

1013
00:38:24,132 --> 00:38:26,367
Because it was last-minute

1014
00:38:26,401 --> 00:38:27,968
and because you needed me
to help convince your girlfriend

1015
00:38:28,002 --> 00:38:29,436
that you don't like me.

1016
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,504
You did it to get to me.

1017
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:32,605
This is crazy.
It's just stupid.

1018
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,641
You don't even like
the guy, Rachel.

1019
00:38:34,675 --> 00:38:37,711
Jenny comes to drop off a suit
at the office,

1020
00:38:37,745 --> 00:38:39,212
and what do you do?

1021
00:38:39,246 --> 00:38:40,814
You kiss me.

1022
00:38:40,848 --> 00:38:43,283
You know, I seem to recall
you kissing me too.

1023
00:38:43,317 --> 00:38:44,350
Yeah, that's the problem.

1024
00:38:44,385 --> 00:38:46,185
I did.
And it was great.

1025
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,286
But it's too late.

1026
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,321
You were too late.

1027
00:38:49,356 --> 00:38:50,356
And I can't do any of this.

1028
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,124
- Do what?
- This, this.

1029
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:54,259
This you joking
about your first time or--

1030
00:38:54,294 --> 00:38:58,097
or rubbing my shoulders
or--or touching my arm.

1031
00:38:58,131 --> 00:39:00,333
You're playing with me,
and you know it.

1032
00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:02,235
What I know is
you're playing with me too.

1033
00:39:02,269 --> 00:39:03,503
You kept flirting with me

1034
00:39:03,537 --> 00:39:05,137
long after you started
dating her.

1035
00:39:05,172 --> 00:39:08,909
Yeah, well,
that's gonna stop.

1036
00:39:08,943 --> 00:39:09,976
Good.

1037
00:39:10,011 --> 00:39:11,811
You know,
and while you're at it,

1038
00:39:11,846 --> 00:39:13,714
no more running to me
for favors

1039
00:39:13,748 --> 00:39:15,082
or asking me for help.

1040
00:39:15,116 --> 00:39:16,717
How 'bout you find yourself
some other paralegal?

1041
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:19,921
Because as far as I'm concerned,
we're done.

1042
00:39:22,724 --> 00:39:25,726
[Indistinct chatter]

1043
00:39:29,564 --> 00:39:32,567
Uh, can you give us
a minute?

1044
00:39:36,105 --> 00:39:38,873
Well, Jessica.

1045
00:39:38,908 --> 00:39:42,411
I've spoken
to Alexandra Leeds.

1046
00:39:42,445 --> 00:39:44,346
She told me
about the deal you cut.

1047
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:48,216
What do you want me
to say?

1048
00:39:48,251 --> 00:39:49,985
Hmm.

1049
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:52,988
This is a copy.

1050
00:39:53,022 --> 00:39:55,390
I'm driving over
to the Attorney General's office

1051
00:39:55,425 --> 00:39:57,059
right now.

1052
00:39:57,093 --> 00:39:58,961
If she doesn't tell me
you've cut a new deal

1053
00:39:58,995 --> 00:40:00,529
by the time I get there,

1054
00:40:00,563 --> 00:40:03,598
she gets the original.

1055
00:40:03,633 --> 00:40:07,401
And then I give her
the proof.

1056
00:40:07,436 --> 00:40:09,604
You don't have the proof.

1057
00:40:09,638 --> 00:40:14,374
Don't I?

1058
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:17,211
Cut a new deal.

1059
00:40:17,245 --> 00:40:19,914
And if you ever mess
with one of mine again,

1060
00:40:19,948 --> 00:40:23,384
Alexandra gets that anyway.

1061
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,136
You don't have to testify.

1062
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:44,971
They don't need you anymore.

1063
00:40:45,006 --> 00:40:47,007
Cameron made a deal?

1064
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:50,410
He made a deal
to sell you out.

1065
00:40:50,444 --> 00:40:52,512
But I made my own deal.

1066
00:40:52,547 --> 00:40:53,914
He'll be stepping down,

1067
00:40:53,948 --> 00:40:57,017
spending some quality time
with his family.

1068
00:40:57,051 --> 00:40:58,452
How exactly
did you manage that?

1069
00:40:58,486 --> 00:41:00,020
Not your concern.

1070
00:41:00,054 --> 00:41:02,823
But you're
in the clear, Harvey.

1071
00:41:05,393 --> 00:41:07,327
Some people would be happy
with that news.

1072
00:41:07,361 --> 00:41:10,296
That son of a bitch.

1073
00:41:10,331 --> 00:41:12,832
Clifford Danner was 18.

1074
00:41:12,866 --> 00:41:14,200
I put him in jail
12 years ago.

1075
00:41:14,234 --> 00:41:18,437
Kid's been rotting in prison
his whole adult life.

1076
00:41:18,472 --> 00:41:21,274
And?

1077
00:41:21,308 --> 00:41:24,376
He's innocent.

1078
00:41:24,411 --> 00:41:26,011
Cameron buried the evidence.

1079
00:41:26,046 --> 00:41:27,847
If I'd had it...

1080
00:41:27,881 --> 00:41:30,049
Do you have enough
to overturn?

1081
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:33,085
I don't know.

1082
00:41:38,025 --> 00:41:41,027
So what are you going to do?

1083
00:41:43,731 --> 00:41:45,699
I'm gonna get him out.

1084
