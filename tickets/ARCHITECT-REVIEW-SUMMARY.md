## Strategic Themes Addressed
1. **Critical Bug Fix** (TICKET-003): 1 ticket, < 1 day
   - Impact: Restores API endpoint functionality
   - Key ticket: TICKET-003
   
2. **Foundation Refactoring** (TICKET-001, TICKET-002): 2 tickets, 1-2 weeks
   - Impact: Eliminates largest code duplication, standardizes resource management
   - Key tickets: TICKET-001 (service layer), TICKET-002 (temp file management)
   
3. **Code Quality Improvements** (TICKET-004, TICKET-005): 2 tickets, 1-2 weeks
   - Impact: Consolidates filename sanitization, integrates error handler
   - Key tickets: TICKET-004 (filename utils), TICKET-005 (error handler)

## Architectural Direction

### Immediate Focus (Phase 0)
**TICKET-003: Critical Bug Fix**
- Runtime error in `get_job_expressions` endpoint
- Simple fix - replace undefined `jobs_db` with Redis
- Deploy immediately

### Short-term (Phase 1 - Weeks 1-2)
**Foundation Refactoring**
- **TICKET-001:** Extract 450+ lines of duplicate pipeline logic into unified service layer
  - Creates `VideoPipelineService` as thin wrapper around `LangFlixPipeline`
  - Unifies API and CLI pipelines (single source of truth)
  - Foundation for other improvements
  
- **TICKET-002:** Standardize temp file management across codebase
  - Creates `TempFileManager` with context manager pattern
  - Prevents disk space leaks
  - Automatic cleanup even on exceptions

### Medium-term (Phase 2 - Weeks 3-4)
**Code Quality Improvements**
- **TICKET-004:** Consolidate filename sanitization (7+ duplicate implementations)
  - Creates `filename_utils.py` with cross-platform support
  - Security enhancement (filename injection protection)
  - Follows DRY principle
  
- **TICKET-005:** Integrate existing error handler into codebase
  - Leverages existing investment (`error_handler.py` fully implemented but unused)
  - Gradual integration with decorator pattern
  - Improves reliability with structured error handling and retry

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Service Layer Pattern
- **Context:** Need to eliminate 450+ lines of duplicate code between API and CLI
- **Decision:** Create `VideoPipelineService` as thin wrapper around `LangFlixPipeline`
- **Rationale:** Single source of truth, minimal changes, easy to test
- **Impact:** All video processing uses unified service, easier to maintain and extend

### Decision 2: Global TempFileManager
- **Context:** Inconsistent temp file management across modules causes disk leaks
- **Decision:** Use global singleton `TempFileManager` with context managers
- **Rationale:** Simple, sufficient for current needs, can migrate to DI later if needed
- **Impact:** Consistent temp file management, automatic cleanup, prevents disk leaks

### Decision 3: Gradual Error Handler Integration
- **Context:** `error_handler.py` exists but unused, custom retry logic in `expression_analyzer.py`
- **Decision:** Gradual integration using decorator pattern, start with core workflows
- **Rationale:** Low risk, preserves existing behavior, can adjust as needed
- **Impact:** Structured error handling, automatic retry, better debugging

### Decision 4: Centralized Filename Sanitization
- **Context:** 7+ files have different filename sanitization implementations
- **Decision:** Create unified utility with cross-platform support
- **Rationale:** DRY principle, security enhancement, easier testing
- **Impact:** Consistent filename generation, better security, single place to maintain

## Risks and Mitigations
**Highest risks identified:**

1. **TICKET-001: Breaking API behavior**
   - Risk: API response format changes
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive integration tests, ensure response format unchanged
   - Contingency: Keep old `process_video_task` as backup until fully tested

2. **TICKET-002: Temp file cleanup issues**
   - Risk: Files accessed after cleanup
   - Mitigation: Clear documentation, use `delete=False` when file needs to persist
   - Contingency: Gradual migration, can revert if issues arise

3. **TICKET-004: Filename format changes**
   - Risk: Breaking existing file lookups
   - Mitigation: Test thoroughly - ensure expression matching still works (critical)
   - Contingency: Simple revert if issues arise

4. **TICKET-005: Error handler behavior changes**
   - Risk: Breaking existing error handling
   - Mitigation: Gradual integration, verify existing behavior preserved
   - Contingency: Can revert individual integrations if issues arise

## Resource Requirements
- Timeline: 3-4 weeks (2 sprints)
- Skills needed:
  - Backend engineer: 2-3 weeks (TICKET-001, TICKET-005)
  - Mid-level engineer: 1-2 weeks (TICKET-002, TICKET-004)
  - Any developer: < 1 day (TICKET-003)
- Infrastructure: None (all code changes)

## Success Criteria
We'll know this roadmap is successful when:
- [ ] Critical bug fixed and deployed (TICKET-003)
- [ ] Service layer established with unified pipeline (TICKET-001)
- [ ] Temp file management standardized (TICKET-002)
- [ ] Filename sanitization consolidated (TICKET-004)
- [ ] Error handler integrated in core workflows (TICKET-005)
- [ ] Code duplication reduced by 80%+ (from ~500 lines)
- [ ] All tests passing, performance impact < 5%
- [ ] Documentation updated for all changes

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate:** Start TICKET-003 (critical bug fix) - deploy today
2. **This Week:** Plan Phase 1 (TICKET-001, TICKET-002) execution
3. **Next Sprint (Weeks 1-2):** Execute Phase 1 (service layer, temp file management)
4. **Following Sprint (Weeks 3-4):** Execute Phase 2 (filename sanitization, error handler)
5. **Ongoing:** Monitor progress, adjust timeline as needed
6. **After Phase 1:** Review progress, adjust Phase 2 if needed

## Feedback Welcome
This review prioritizes:
- **Immediate:** Fixing critical bug that blocks users
- **Short-term:** Establishing foundation for long-term maintainability
- **Medium-term:** Improving code quality and reliability

If business priorities shift or new information emerges, we can revisit decisions.

Areas particularly open to discussion:
- Service layer design details (can refine during TICKET-001 implementation)
- Error handler integration scope (can adjust during TICKET-005 implementation)
- Timeline adjustments (can adjust based on team capacity)
