What is the oldest book in
the Harvard library collection?

- The Bible.
- Wrong.

The Gutenberg Bible.

8
00:00:14,812 --> 00:00:16,385
Everyone knows
it's the Gutenberg Bible.

9
00:00:16,453 --> 00:00:17,617
Yes, but you didn't say it.

10
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,719
The rules dictate
you must be precise,

a very precise endeavor.

- How many U.S. Pr--
- Eight.

13
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:25,819
That's not fair, you didn't
even finish the question.

14
00:00:25,887 --> 00:00:27,720
And yet it's right.
The question was gonna be

15
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:29,555
"How many U.S. Presidents
attended Harvard?"

- You want names?
- No, we get it.

Final round.
Ross ahead by one.

One question each.
Points are double.

19

Double 'cause he wants
to keep you in the game, Seth.

Oh, venomous banter.
This is adorable, I love it.

Where do you get it?

Any self-respecting

would know the answer
to that.

Nope.

- Ruth Bader Ginsberg

She graduated from Columbia,

47
00:01:38,774 --> 00:01:40,741
after she attended Harvard
for two years.

48
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,343
The question was phrased

49
00:01:42,411 --> 00:01:44,411
"How many justices were
from Harvard?"

50
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,279
Well, she was on
the <i>Harvard Law Review.</i>

51
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:48,281
And when she arrived
at Columbia as a transfer,

52
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:49,682
she was from Harvard.

be so sure about that?

Because you're walking
with me right now.

69
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:37,738
He did this whole
Harvard trivia thing,

70
00:02:37,806 --> 00:02:38,739
and then he brought up
this pizza--

71

Doesn't mean he knows.

Louis is devious,

He won't think we did this.

think to do it himself.

Doubloons?

85

The ridiculousness of
your suggestion

86

a silly word.

Mm-hmm.

Why was he holding your hands?
Kissing them?

What are
you implying, Harvey?

I don't know, maybe
you two are going steady.

95
00:03:34,436 --> 00:03:37,105
I was implying
that it looked like

96
00:03:37,172 --> 00:03:39,140
he was grateful to you
for taking his case.

97
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,276
Good, 'cause that's
exactly what it was.

98
00:03:41,344 --> 00:03:43,312
That's a bad move.
We may make money

99
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,380
billing out on their defense,
but when we lose--

100
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:47,683
which we will--it's gonna
hurt us in the long run.

101
00:03:47,751 --> 00:03:51,019
- How do you know we'll lose?
- Because it's my job to know.

And his company's A.L.S.
wonder drug is killing people.

103

A.L.S. is incurable.

104
00:03:56,093 --> 00:03:57,760
And everyone
who is taking that drug

105
00:03:57,827 --> 00:03:59,395
is going to die anyway.

106

Hm.
That's your defense?

107
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:04,733
If he kills them a little
faster, it's a public service?

108
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:08,904
Our defense is
those allegations are untrue.

109
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:10,473
He has taken
this story all over town,

110
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,408
and not a single firm thinks
he has a case.

111
00:04:12,476 --> 00:04:14,010
Which is why he came to me.

112
00:04:14,078 --> 00:04:15,879
Because he wants someone
who believes in him.

113
00:04:15,947 --> 00:04:18,415
And what is it exactly
that makes you believe in him?

- I didn't forget that.

I have no intention of
taking this case.

Though, I did get you this.

- What is it?
- A wedding gift.

133

I'm sorry it's so late,
but it's hard to be on time

00:05:20,782 --> 00:05:23,717
when I never
knew you were married.

135

Are you
seeing anyone, Harvey?

00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,121
Hm?

137
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:29,956
You don't wanna tell me,
and I don't really care.

138
00:05:30,024 --> 00:05:32,592
Because you and I share
the same trait

139
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,193
of keeping our
personal lives personal.

140
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:35,828
You were married.

141
00:05:35,896 --> 00:05:38,030
It happened when you were at
Harvard, didn't work out.

142
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:39,965
We were too dedicated
to our careers,

143
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:42,068
and that's all
I'm going to say about it.

144
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:43,836
Okay.
You're right.

145
00:05:43,904 --> 00:05:45,938
It's none of my business.

146
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:48,273
- I'm still not taking this case.
- Why is that?

147
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:50,975
Because sometimes I do things
that my clients don't like.

148
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:53,345
And if their ex-wives
are looking over my shoulders,

149
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:54,780
that's not really a problem.

150
00:05:54,848 --> 00:05:57,916
But when their ex-wives
are also my managing partner,

151
00:05:57,984 --> 00:05:59,818
that hamstrings me.

152
00:05:59,886 --> 00:06:02,488
And if I'm gonna turn
this loser into a winner,

153
00:06:02,555 --> 00:06:04,289
I can't be hamstrung.
I can't have that.

it is to develop a new drug

This is important, Harvey.

159
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:24,110
If Quentin came to you looking
for someone to trust him,

160
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:25,745
why aren't you handling
this case yourself?

161
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:27,347
That's none of your concern.

162
00:06:27,414 --> 00:06:29,549
Well, I'm not asking you
that as your colleague,

163
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:32,151
I'm asking you
as Quentin's attorney.

164
00:06:36,656 --> 00:06:38,356
After Quentin and I
separated,

165
00:06:38,424 --> 00:06:42,493
he started seeing
one of his research consultants.

They're still together.

167
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:46,664
But he never married her.

168
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:48,099
She doesn't want me
on the case.

169
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,366
Oh, terrific.

170
00:06:49,434 --> 00:06:50,835
You're sticking me with
a losing case,

171
00:06:50,902 --> 00:06:52,136
and a girlfriend
who isn't gonna like me

172
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,671
anymore than she likes you.

173
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:56,006
Well, I'm sure
it's not the first time

174
00:06:56,074 --> 00:06:57,808
someone hasn't liked you,
Harvey.

175

[Retreating footsteps]
Who doesn't like me?

176
00:07:03,148 --> 00:07:04,816
Picture the devil
without the charm.

177
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,684
Okay, so Karinski owned
this building for two years?

178
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,453
Yeah, then things got bad.

179
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,756
Three below, the heat went out
and I nearly froze to death.

180
00:07:10,823 --> 00:07:12,224
Then a gas leak in my stove.

181
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:14,060
You could smell the damn thing,
but he said it was fine.

182
00:07:14,127 --> 00:07:16,262
I called for a month,
then I had to replace it myself.

183
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,331
Why didn't you just move?

184
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,301
This is the apartment
that I grew up in.

185
00:07:20,368 --> 00:07:21,768
It's the only place
I've ever known.

186
00:07:21,836 --> 00:07:23,770
I don't have
any brothers or sisters.

187
00:07:23,838 --> 00:07:26,173
My parents...
Not with me anymore.

188
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:29,243
I'm not leaving the
one connection I have to them.

189
00:07:29,311 --> 00:07:32,613
You said you weren't sleeping.
Are you stressed out, or--?

190
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:34,916
- Bedbugs.
- No.

191
00:07:34,983 --> 00:07:37,251
My place is literally
crawling with them.

192
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,688
Could you sleep knowing the
minute you turn out the light,

193
00:07:39,755 --> 00:07:41,590
they're coming for you?
No, I couldn't.

194
00:07:41,658 --> 00:07:43,693
Well, Karinski won't do
anything about it without proof,

195
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,861
and I can't get someone
from the city down

196
00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:46,196
to verify they're there.

197
00:07:46,263 --> 00:07:49,066
Don't worry.
I can.

Two weeks.
Next Thursday.

199

I-I-I-I don't think
that you heard me.

200
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:54,439
I need someone
down there today.

201
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:56,574
- Two weeks, next Thursday.
- Okay.

202
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,744
Uh, I'd like to speak
to your supervisor, please.

203
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,145
You can do that
next Wednesday.

204
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,282
Okay, Glenda, let me
tell you what I'm gonna do

205
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,083
between now
and next Wednesday...

206
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,585
I know exactly
what you're gonna do.

207
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,253
You're gonna do what
every lawyer threatens to do.

208
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,088
You're gonna
file a 409/3 grievance

209
00:08:10,155 --> 00:08:11,956
claiming that I did
not fulfill my obligation

210
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,457
to promptly direct you
to my supervisor.

211
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:16,093
A grievance that will
be passed on to my supervisor

212
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:17,895
next Wednesday.

213
00:08:17,962 --> 00:08:21,732
No, what I'm gonna do
is hire a private investigator

214
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,202
to look into
every aspect of your life

215
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:26,838
from the day you were born
until next Tuesday.

216
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:29,074
And then I'm gonna use
whatever it is they find

217
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,976
to make you wish
that your biggest problem

218
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:35,181
was keeping this job
that you seem to hate so much.

219
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:39,152
Yeah, I'm not like
every other lawyer, Glenda.

220
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,453
What did you say
your name was?

221
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,256
Specter.

222
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:46,192
Harvey Specter.

223
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:51,965
- You're a baseball fan?
- Oh, yeah.

224
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,767
Then I assume you know
Lou Gehrig was a bad man.

225
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:58,037
They didn't call him
the Iron Horse for nothing.

226
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:01,073
Then he got A.L.S.
you know what it did to him?

227
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,276
His hands locked up,
then his legs,

228
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:05,278
his speech,
eventually his breathing.

229
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:06,546
Couldn't control 'em.

230
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:09,249
His mind knew what it wanted,
but his body--

231
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:12,652
he was trapped inside,
unable to do anything.

232
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,088
Even today, you get A.L.S.,

233
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:15,656
within three to five years,
you die.

234
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:18,192
Or sooner, if someone takes
your drug and their liver fails.

235
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,828
Our drug makes people's
remaining years better,

236
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:22,630
and it doubles
their life expectancy.

237
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:24,331
Except for the people
who's livers are failing.

238
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,367
- You don't--
- Lisa.

239

[Whispers]
It's okay.

I can see why Jessica likes you.
You cut through the bullsh--.

That's something
I always loved about her.

242
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,278
She just does it with
a little less charm than I do.

243
00:09:37,345 --> 00:09:38,846
Isn't she
a little taller than you?

244
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:40,581
- It's the heels.
- Let me tell you what it takes

245
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:42,717
to get a drug approved today.

246
00:09:42,785 --> 00:09:44,719
We were $139 million
into development

247
00:09:44,787 --> 00:09:46,955
before we
ever hit the shelves.

248
00:09:47,023 --> 00:09:49,091
We jumped through
every hoop they threw at us,

249
00:09:49,158 --> 00:09:51,293
and we proved our drug
was safe for eight years.

250
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:52,894
So you're saying
these claims are baseless?

251
00:09:52,962 --> 00:09:55,097
We're talking
about six terminal patients

252
00:09:55,164 --> 00:09:57,065
with a wide array of
medical issues

253
00:09:57,132 --> 00:09:59,634
and they're saying
my company's drug caused this?

254
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:02,703
They were drinking coffee
on the <i>Titanic.</i>

255
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:05,640
I don't think that put
Leonardo DiCaprio in the water.

256
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,075
Since Jessica vouched
for you,

257
00:10:07,143 --> 00:10:09,311
I'm gonna go ahead and
believe what you're telling me.

258
00:10:09,378 --> 00:10:11,947
But since these other firms
determined you have exposure,

259
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:13,815
here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna pay them.

260
00:10:13,883 --> 00:10:15,484
We're gonna pay them
a little bit of money

261
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:18,520
so you can keep saving lives,
because if we drag this out,

262
00:10:18,588 --> 00:10:20,789
people won't think of your drug
as a way to save lives,

263
00:10:20,857 --> 00:10:24,159
they'll think of it as
a death sentence.

264
00:10:25,928 --> 00:10:27,295
The guy from
the housing department's

about five minutes.

266
00:10:28,865 --> 00:10:30,532
How did you manage that?

267
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:31,900
You know, they're
actually pretty receptive

268
00:10:31,968 --> 00:10:34,937
when you explain
the situation to them.

269
00:10:35,005 --> 00:10:37,406
That's what you have to do
to prevent the spread.

270
00:10:37,474 --> 00:10:39,242
I had to get rid of most
of my things--

271
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:41,477
clothes,
record collection, books.

272
00:10:41,545 --> 00:10:43,279
I had a first edition
<i>Catcher in the Rye,</i>

273
00:10:43,346 --> 00:10:44,747
you know what that was worth?
No.

274

The bugs can live dormant
for 18 months.

275

You just have
to throw everything out.

Funny you should mention that,

'cause you haven't
paid rent in four months,

so I wasn't sure.

because you haven't--
- Frank has withheld rent

283
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:05,367
because the apartment
is not habitable.

section 27-20--
- Hey, no rent, no apartment.

That's my code.

287
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:16,144
But if you
want something legal...

288
00:11:16,212 --> 00:11:18,646
there's a court order.
You got three days to get out.

I went to the client's place,

295

it was overrun with bedbugs,
so I went back to the office--

296

You tracked bedbugs
into my office?

297

- No.
- You walked in there naked?

No, Donna met me in

Okay, Donna's fired, and
you're buying me an extra suit.

and Mr. Specter,

311
00:12:24,212 --> 00:12:26,714
lately arrived to
our little legal dispute.

312
00:12:26,782 --> 00:12:30,551
You say legal dispute,
I say shakedown.

313
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:33,287
Always a fine line between
the two, <i>n'est pas?</i>

314
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:35,189
Look, we can
sit here and posture

315
00:12:35,257 --> 00:12:37,291
about the strengths
and weaknesses of our cases,

316
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:39,193
but frankly, that's gonna
bore the hell out of me.

317
00:12:42,231 --> 00:12:44,031
Seriously?

318
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:47,434
- It could be much lower.
- It could be much higher.

319
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:49,537
Then let's pretend
it's just right.

320
00:12:49,604 --> 00:12:52,906
My client's lives are
being cut short.

321
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:55,809
And according to
accepted calculations,

322
00:12:55,877 --> 00:12:59,980
the current value of a life
is $7.9 million.

323
00:13:00,048 --> 00:13:03,016
You're not even
offering pennies on that.

324
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:05,151
Those happen
to be E.P.A. calculations

325
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:07,220
based on
a full life expectancy.

326
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:08,722
Adjusted for plaintiffs

327
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,424
who's expectancy
is just a fragment of this,

328
00:13:10,492 --> 00:13:14,728
yields a value of $143,427.

329
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:17,864
Approximately.

330
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:21,268
What your child fails
to understand is that

331
00:13:21,336 --> 00:13:24,338
for someone with only
three to five years to live,

332
00:13:24,406 --> 00:13:27,308
each day is
worth infinitely more.

333
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,778
But the real crux
is the punitive damages.

334
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:34,249
Because if your client
wants to sell me the idea

335
00:13:34,317 --> 00:13:38,187
that he didn't know about
these side effects years ago,

336
00:13:38,255 --> 00:13:39,522
I'm not buying it.

337
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,291
Which is why
we want $250 million.

338
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:43,792
- What?
- Quentin.

339
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,395
No, man.
This is outrageous.

340
00:13:46,462 --> 00:13:47,596
Do you know what you're doing?

341
00:13:47,664 --> 00:13:49,164
You're bankrupting this company

342
00:13:49,232 --> 00:13:51,233
and taking away years of life
from real people

343
00:13:51,301 --> 00:13:53,502
who are walking, talking,
and breathing easier

344
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,137
because of the drug we make.

345
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:58,074
I don't represent
those people.

346
00:13:58,141 --> 00:14:00,776
My clients--
- Have tenuous claims at best.

347
00:14:00,844 --> 00:14:02,878
And unless one of your six
is Rupert Murdoch,

348
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:04,947
you're out of your mind.
[Sighs]

349
00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:08,184
Okay.

350
00:14:11,087 --> 00:14:12,154
You printed that?

351
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:14,690
Well, not yet.
But I will.

352
00:14:14,758 --> 00:14:15,925
You realize
that's libelous.

353
00:14:15,992 --> 00:14:17,927
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

354
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:20,396
But after it runs,
you and I both know,

355
00:14:20,463 --> 00:14:21,897
it won't much matter.

356
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:24,533
We're done here.
I don't take to extortion.

357
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:26,468
I'm not gonna be bullied by
an ambulance-chaser,

358
00:14:26,536 --> 00:14:29,305
no matter how nice his suit.
It is nice, isn't it?

359
00:14:29,372 --> 00:14:31,373
Italian.
And it fits.

360
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,910
$250 million, Mr. Sainz.

361
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:37,812
I'll give you four days.

362
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:48,589
Church wants to play,
we play.

363
00:14:48,657 --> 00:14:50,291
[Thud]

364
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:51,726
I have housing court
in the morning.

365
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:54,095
It's housing court.
Your grandmother could win.

366
00:14:54,163 --> 00:14:56,331
- [Sighs]
- Let's see just how real

367
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,899
his clients'
liver problems are.

368
00:14:57,967 --> 00:14:59,835
Are if they are real,
we suggest they're from

369
00:14:59,902 --> 00:15:02,638
the disease itself,
or they took the wrong dose,

370
00:15:02,705 --> 00:15:05,174
or they took a cocktail
of combined drugs.

371
00:15:05,242 --> 00:15:08,211
Also, I wanna see
Quentin's company financials.

372
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:09,412
I already
asked for them once.

373
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,147
I want you to call them
and follow-up.

374
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:13,249
I wanna know everything
Church could go after.

375
00:15:13,317 --> 00:15:16,318
So we've gone from
settlement to scorched earth.

376
00:15:16,386 --> 00:15:19,021
I didn't feel like writing
a $1/4 billion check.

377
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:20,656
- It's a negotiation.
- Exactly.

378
00:15:20,724 --> 00:15:22,558
That's why I'm arming myself
for the next round.

379
00:15:22,626 --> 00:15:24,426
By digging into Quentin?

380
00:15:24,494 --> 00:15:26,328
I'm a boy scout.
I like to be prepared.

381
00:15:26,396 --> 00:15:28,263
Hmm.

382
00:15:29,866 --> 00:15:32,734
So you think
you'll look like a boy scout

383
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:34,268
by putting dying people
on the stand

384
00:15:34,336 --> 00:15:35,771
and tearing them apart?

385
00:15:35,838 --> 00:15:36,972
[Thuds]
Mm.

386
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,507
You're gonna
look like an asshole.

387
00:15:38,575 --> 00:15:40,609
For every one they claim
has a side effect,

388
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:42,579
we have 600 who don't.

389
00:15:42,647 --> 00:15:45,549
And if I need to look like
an asshole to convince the jury

390
00:15:45,616 --> 00:15:48,052
that hundreds are
more important than the one,

391
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,920
I'm not gonna lose
a minute's sleep over it.

392
00:15:49,988 --> 00:15:54,425
Well, I have court
in the morning.

393
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:56,861
Oh, I'm--
I'm not clear.

394
00:15:56,928 --> 00:15:59,297
Was this a conversation with
my managing partner

395
00:15:59,364 --> 00:16:00,831
or my client's ex-wife?

396
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,267
You need to
settle this case, Harvey.

397
00:16:03,335 --> 00:16:05,236
Which I will do
if you stay out of it...

398
00:16:05,304 --> 00:16:08,072
As you promised.

399
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,742
Make it go away.

400
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:14,346
- Rachel.
- Go away.

401
00:16:14,413 --> 00:16:15,881
- I need to talk to you.
- Oh, oh.

402
00:16:15,948 --> 00:16:19,318
Who's picking on you now, Mikey?
Mom and dad are fighting.

403
00:16:19,386 --> 00:16:21,286
Harvey and Jessica.
What do you care?

404
00:16:21,354 --> 00:16:22,922
Oh, I'm just rattled.

405
00:16:22,989 --> 00:16:25,725
My first trial tomorrow
in housing court.

406
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:27,961
Housing court?

407
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,597
I could win at housing court.
You'll be fine.

408
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:33,433
- [Sighs]
- But not if you wear that suit.

409
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:45,544
Carvello versus
Karinski Properties.

410
00:16:45,612 --> 00:16:47,279
So how does
this usually work?

411
00:16:47,346 --> 00:16:51,383
Uh, well, usually
the trial starts,

412
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,285
and there's the judge,
and then...you know,

413
00:16:54,353 --> 00:16:55,987
people say things.

414
00:16:56,055 --> 00:16:58,290
You've never done
this before, have you?

415
00:16:58,358 --> 00:16:59,992
Well,
I never drove a car before

416
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,461
the first time I drove one,
and I'm still here, aren't I?

417
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:04,364
[Sighs]

418
00:17:04,432 --> 00:17:06,233
This is your first time?

419
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:08,101
I'm your first?

420
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:11,239
Don't worry, I promise
not to be gentle.

421
00:17:11,306 --> 00:17:13,808
Frank.
It's nice to see you.

422
00:17:13,876 --> 00:17:15,310
One last time.

423
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,013
If it pleases the court--

424
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:22,483
It pleases the court
to decide who speaks and when.

425
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,887
I'll sit down.

426
00:17:26,955 --> 00:17:29,989
We're talking about $4,000
in withheld rent pas--

427
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:32,025
Yes, Your Honor.
But we have receipts

428
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,827
for repairs, lost clothing,
as well as...

429
00:17:36,363 --> 00:17:38,264
$4,000.
Yes, Your Honor.

430
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:39,599
[Whispers]
She was talking to me.

431
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:43,037
Oh.
[Chuckles]

432
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,806
Why hasn't he paid,
counselor?

433
00:17:45,874 --> 00:17:47,541
Uh, that one was for you.

434
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,143
Bedbugs, Your Honor.

435
00:17:49,211 --> 00:17:52,679
I have receipts that show
my client's financial outlay

436
00:17:52,747 --> 00:17:55,582
to rectify the problem
far exceeds the amount.

437
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,619
Housing department certified
the presence of bedbugs?

438
00:17:58,687 --> 00:18:00,354
- Uh, yes, Your Honor.
- Abatement?

439
00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:05,593
Excuse me.

440
00:18:05,661 --> 00:18:08,396
I'll do it.
There you go.

441
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:11,933
Your Honor, this is
an eviction hearing.

442
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:14,135
The pertinent question is
not habitability,

443
00:18:14,202 --> 00:18:15,770
but whether or not rent
has been paid.

444
00:18:15,837 --> 00:18:19,473
Actually, city code states
that rent may be withheld

445
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,576
if the warranty of
habitability is breached.

446
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,279
Mm.

447
00:18:24,346 --> 00:18:26,181
In that case, we request
to see the checks

448
00:18:26,248 --> 00:18:27,748
Mr. Ross' client
has placed in escrow.

449
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:31,118
- The--uh...
- Checks, in escrow.

450
00:18:31,186 --> 00:18:32,953
Pending the outcome of
a rent abatement hearing?

451
00:18:33,021 --> 00:18:37,792
- That's not in the code.
- It is the accepted practice.

452
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,495
And therefore
binding in this courtroom.

453
00:18:40,563 --> 00:18:43,566
Your client did put money
in escrow, I assume.

454
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:44,934
- I didn't have any money left--
- Your Honor...

455
00:18:45,002 --> 00:18:46,602
[Gavel pounds]
Eviction upheld.

456
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,205
- But Your Honor, he--
- Did you see me bang the gavel?

457
00:18:49,273 --> 00:18:51,642
That means step aside.
Next case.

458
00:18:53,211 --> 00:18:56,079
You never forget your first.

459
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:05,388
You know what happens
to pitchers

460
00:19:05,455 --> 00:19:07,023
when they get shelled
in rookie league, Mike?

461
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:08,791
You think they make it
to the bigs?

462
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:11,194
Or do they just end up

463
00:19:11,262 --> 00:19:13,397
on some sad American Legion
team of has-beens?

464
00:19:13,464 --> 00:19:15,098
I get it, I lost.
I'm sorry.

465
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,033
[Chuckles]

466
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:20,537
Well, you're sorry.

467
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:23,407
In that case--
- No, I am sorry.

468
00:19:23,474 --> 00:19:25,709
But right now I have
some research to do for Harvey,

469
00:19:25,777 --> 00:19:27,644
so if you'll excuse me.
Remember when you stole

470
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:29,479
that client
I had you bring in?

471
00:19:29,547 --> 00:19:31,014
That was a good time
for you, wasn't it?

472
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:34,050
See, I gave you a nothing case
so that when you did win

473
00:19:34,118 --> 00:19:37,120
it would still do
nothing for your career.

474
00:19:37,187 --> 00:19:40,557
But I still
expected you to win.

475
00:19:40,624 --> 00:19:43,659
So yeah, I guess...
Go back to your research.

476
00:19:43,727 --> 00:19:45,895
Maybe that is your niche.

477
00:19:45,963 --> 00:19:47,930
[Chuckles]

478
00:19:47,998 --> 00:19:49,632
Maybe it is.

479
00:19:57,507 --> 00:20:00,642
Most mornings,
I can make it out of the chair

480
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,979
and get across the floor.
[Giggles]

481
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:05,347
And I can hold my daughter.

482
00:20:09,152 --> 00:20:10,986
How many were in the study?

483
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:14,422
412, over 2 years.

484
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,090
And we have videos of
all of them.

485
00:20:16,158 --> 00:20:18,025
25% were given placebos,

486
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:20,628
the rest,
varying doses of Amylinx.

487
00:20:20,695 --> 00:20:22,630
And more than half are
like that one,

488
00:20:22,697 --> 00:20:24,398
showing significant
signs of improvement.

489
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:26,900
And you're telling me there
was nothing affecting the liver?

490
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:28,535
Yes.

491
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:32,071
If you're just coming to
question that, we'll move on.

492
00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:35,109
You don't like it that Quentin
went to his ex-wife, do you?

493
00:20:35,176 --> 00:20:37,044
No, I don't.

494
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:40,281
I don't want any garbage from
the past getting in the way.

495
00:20:40,348 --> 00:20:43,851
I mean, what Quentin's done here
is nothing short of miraculous.

496
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,688
I think I may have found a way
to keep that miracle going.

497
00:20:46,756 --> 00:20:49,424
I was going through
the plaintiff's medical files,

498
00:20:49,492 --> 00:20:52,361
and then I found this.

499
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,898
This is good.

500
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:57,466
This is really good.

501
00:20:57,534 --> 00:20:59,868
Jones versus Norco...

502
00:20:59,936 --> 00:21:02,370
Washburn versus
Hawthorne Incorporated...

503
00:21:02,438 --> 00:21:05,873
Actually, seven cases
that Mr. Church solicited

504
00:21:05,941 --> 00:21:07,641
lawsuits against
pharmaceutical companies.

505
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:11,345
In each case, he was able
to exact a settlement

506
00:21:11,412 --> 00:21:13,613
because the company
knew that even if they won,

507
00:21:13,681 --> 00:21:16,850
a protracted battle would
do more damage than settling.

508
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:18,251
You have evidence of that?

509
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,654
Plaintiff number two
in our case, Eleanor Baker.

510
00:21:20,721 --> 00:21:22,255
She also happens to be

511
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,859
plaintiff number seven in
Jones versus Norco.

512
00:21:24,926 --> 00:21:27,428
He's recycling plaintiffs.
That's very green of you.

513
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:29,097
Mr. Church?

514
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:32,368
Mr. Specter has his
documents, I have mine

515
00:21:32,436 --> 00:21:36,072
showing that prior to
FDA approval of his drug,

516
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,442
Quentin Sainz's company
was on the verge of bankruptcy.

517
00:21:39,509 --> 00:21:42,611
Three months after
that drug hit the market,

518
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:46,015
sales rocketed to
$38 million a quarter,

519
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,451
which is
clear financial motive

520
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:50,220
for falsifying
clinical trials.

521
00:21:50,288 --> 00:21:52,189
Now, Your Honor,
does that sound like

522
00:21:52,257 --> 00:21:55,159
a groundless claim to you?

523
00:21:55,227 --> 00:21:56,861
[Whisper] I told you
to go over those financials.

524
00:21:56,929 --> 00:21:59,197
I asked him five times,
he never gave them to me.

525
00:21:59,265 --> 00:22:01,633
- Your Honor.
- Mr. Specter,

526
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,869
you can question his tactics
all you like at trial,

527
00:22:03,936 --> 00:22:05,237
but he's right.

528
00:22:05,305 --> 00:22:07,172
That right there is
financial motive for fraud

529
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,142
this case is moving forward.
[Gavel drops]

530
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,677
Thank you, Your Honor.

531
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,170
Jessica,
what're you doing here?

532
00:22:32,238 --> 00:22:33,405
Get in.

533
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,107
I was just about to
get some coffee.

534
00:22:44,683 --> 00:22:46,284
Heard about your
little setback in court.

535
00:22:46,352 --> 00:22:49,020
Getting blind-sided
by my own client holding back

536
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,689
isn't a setback,
it's an embarrassment.

537
00:22:50,757 --> 00:22:52,358
- What are you talking about?
- Did you ever think

538
00:22:52,426 --> 00:22:54,194
it's time to consider that
he isn't the upstanding man

539
00:22:54,261 --> 00:22:56,763
that you think he is?

540
00:22:56,831 --> 00:22:59,967
[Sighs]
When we were married...

541
00:23:00,035 --> 00:23:02,003
When I took a client
Quentin knew was guilty,

542
00:23:02,071 --> 00:23:03,438
he never shut up about it.

543
00:23:03,506 --> 00:23:05,874
He went on, and on,
about right and wrong.

544
00:23:05,941 --> 00:23:07,275
Sounds annoyingly
self-righteous.

545
00:23:07,343 --> 00:23:08,643
It was.

546
00:23:08,711 --> 00:23:10,879
But it's also how I know
he didn't do this.

547
00:23:10,947 --> 00:23:14,015
For all his faults, Quentin has
never lied to me before.

548
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:17,452
And he's not lying about this.

549
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,389
So stop questioning his ethics
and start winning this case.

550
00:23:20,457 --> 00:23:22,524
We had a deal that
you were gonna stay out of it.

551
00:23:22,592 --> 00:23:24,226
You don't know
everything I know.

552
00:23:25,796 --> 00:23:27,730
- All right.
- That's not staying out of it.

553
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:29,265
No, you're right.

554
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,068
I'm not staying out
of it anymore.

555
00:23:40,012 --> 00:23:41,312
I'm sorry.

556
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,214
You looked into
his background this deeply?

557
00:23:43,282 --> 00:23:45,316
The investigation
reveals what it reveals.

558
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:47,685
If he lied about this,
he could've lied about anything.

559
00:23:47,753 --> 00:23:49,086
You think I didn't know

560
00:23:49,154 --> 00:23:50,821
he started with Lisa
before we were separated?

561
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:55,225
This is old news, Harvey.
I moved on a long time ago.

562
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:57,794
Jessica, it's
a pattern of behavior.

563
00:23:57,861 --> 00:23:59,262
Quentin came to me
because he knew

564
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,398
I thought he was a good man,
and I still do.

565
00:24:02,465 --> 00:24:04,867
You obviously don't.

566
00:24:04,935 --> 00:24:07,036
I'm taking the case.

567
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,540
What about Lisa?

568
00:24:10,608 --> 00:24:12,743
If Lisa has
a problem with it,

569
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:17,248
then Lisa can
take it up with me.

570
00:24:17,315 --> 00:24:18,449
It's kind of ironic,
isn't it?

571
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:20,485
You and I both
lost in court yesterday.

572
00:24:20,553 --> 00:24:23,321
You lost...
In housing court?

573
00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:25,390
How does one
lose in housing court?

574
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:26,925
People win there
without lawyers.

575
00:24:26,993 --> 00:24:28,994
Well, he had a lawyer,
Tanaka, and she--

576
00:24:29,062 --> 00:24:31,163
- Vivien Tanaka?
- Yeah, what, you know her?

577
00:24:31,231 --> 00:24:32,898
If your landlord's
using Vivien Tanaka,

578
00:24:32,966 --> 00:24:34,734
this isn't about bedbugs.

579
00:24:34,802 --> 00:24:37,704
Vivien Tanaka represents half
the high-rises in Manhattan.

580
00:24:37,772 --> 00:24:40,107
This isn't a petty rent dispute.
Your guy's going condo.

581
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:41,842
Well, that's great.

582
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,911
Forcing Frank out
for conversion is harassment,

583
00:24:43,978 --> 00:24:45,345
I can go after him for that.

584
00:24:45,413 --> 00:24:47,481
No, you wanna
take down Vivien,

585
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:50,184
you better go in there
with more than just one client.

586
00:24:50,251 --> 00:24:52,319
You show the pattern,
the settlement goes up.

587
00:24:52,387 --> 00:24:53,687
If they did this to him,

588
00:24:53,755 --> 00:24:55,422
I guarantee
they've done this to others.

589
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,957
So I should find other
people in Frank's building?

590
00:24:57,025 --> 00:24:59,627
Think bigger.

591
00:24:59,694 --> 00:25:02,530
Bigger how?

592
00:25:07,336 --> 00:25:09,270
Karinski owns five buildings

593
00:25:09,337 --> 00:25:10,972
and they all used to be
rent-controlled,

594
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,007
but now they go for
a million and a half a unit.

595
00:25:13,074 --> 00:25:14,442
Nice profit margin.

596
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:16,143
I went to look for
housing department complaints

597
00:25:16,211 --> 00:25:18,079
in the year
prior to his remodel.

598
00:25:18,146 --> 00:25:20,047
In each one of them,
tenants who couldn't

599
00:25:20,115 --> 00:25:21,415
buy into the conversion
ended up with

600
00:25:21,483 --> 00:25:24,151
some complaint--
garbage, heat, air.

601
00:25:24,219 --> 00:25:26,887
All of them, one by one,
Karinski drove them out.

602
00:25:26,955 --> 00:25:28,222
You couldn't get their
names from housing complaints?

603
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:29,690
No, it gave me some names.

604
00:25:29,758 --> 00:25:32,125
But I need to make this
bigger than just his building.

605
00:25:32,193 --> 00:25:34,127
Look, I only get one hour
off a day for lunch,

606
00:25:34,194 --> 00:25:36,262
and I never take it.
Do you really need me for this?

607
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,764
See these people
who are leaving the building?

608
00:25:37,831 --> 00:25:39,633
Mm-hmm.

609
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,534
The entire building
looks like them.

610
00:25:41,602 --> 00:25:43,637
I know I clean up okay, but...

611
00:25:43,705 --> 00:25:46,139
Mm, you need me
to class you up a bit.

612
00:25:46,207 --> 00:25:48,675
- Not class, but--
- Class.

613
00:25:48,743 --> 00:25:50,277
All right, whatever
gets you through the door.

614
00:25:50,345 --> 00:25:52,045
Come on, are you ready?
Yeah.

615
00:25:52,113 --> 00:25:54,381
Hi, there.
My wife and I

616
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:55,883
are here to see
some of the new units.

617
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,418
Isn't that right, honey?
- Mm-hmm.

618
00:25:58,486 --> 00:26:00,654
So what do you think,
sweetheart?

619
00:26:00,722 --> 00:26:02,389
Hm, it's fine.

620
00:26:02,457 --> 00:26:04,591
But I like the place
on 52nd better.

621
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:07,327
52nd, that's

00:33:12,426 --> 00:33:14,561
but you'd share in
the settlement.

780
00:33:14,628 --> 00:33:16,062
You could open a new company,

781
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:18,464
keep the drug alive under
a different corporate umbrella.

782
00:33:18,532 --> 00:33:19,933
I'm not pretending
I'm one of them.

783
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,503
You are one of them.

784
00:33:23,571 --> 00:33:26,506
Look, I can't do that.
It's not who I am.

785
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:27,907
Now isn't there another way?

786
00:33:27,975 --> 00:33:31,344
You are one of them.

787
00:33:31,412 --> 00:33:32,612
And they're one of you.

788
00:33:37,418 --> 00:33:40,553
Mike, we got work to do,
where are you?

789
00:33:40,621 --> 00:33:43,490
Oh, I'm looking at you
right now in conference room C.

790
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:46,292
I'm sorry,
can you please excuse me?

791
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,828
Aa meeting?
Here in the office?

792
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:50,296
Funny.
No, it's my lawsuit.

793
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:52,232
- Which suit is that?
- Against Johnny Karinski.

794
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,034
Between Frank's building

795
00:33:54,102 --> 00:33:55,936
and the one Rachel and I
are about to buy into.

796
00:33:56,004 --> 00:33:58,038
Oh, yeah.
We're married.

797
00:33:58,106 --> 00:33:59,374
It's a long story.

798
00:33:59,441 --> 00:34:01,142
Look, you said
think bigger, right?

799
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:03,412
I tracked down
15 former tenants

800
00:34:03,479 --> 00:34:06,314
who are willing to testify
to all manner of harassment

801
00:34:06,382 --> 00:34:07,549
that forced them
out of their apartments.

802
00:34:07,617 --> 00:34:08,850
You did this overnight?

803
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:10,585
Yeah, I couldn't
sleep anyway.

804
00:34:10,653 --> 00:34:12,354
Kept thinking I felt bedbugs.

805
00:34:12,422 --> 00:34:14,924
But I can get these people
in front of a judge

806
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:16,859
to tell their story,
and there is no way

807
00:34:16,927 --> 00:34:19,862
that Vivien Tanaka can spin
this to save Karinski's ass.

808
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:22,632
You should hear their stories.

809
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:26,101
It'd break your heart.
Uh, if you had a heart.

810
00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:27,737
Emotion is fine,

811
00:34:27,804 --> 00:34:30,106
but you better have some cold,
hard facts to back it up.

812
00:34:30,173 --> 00:34:32,174
Because Vivien Tanaka
is no pushover.

813
00:34:32,242 --> 00:34:34,010
But...

814
00:34:34,077 --> 00:34:36,379
It's good work.
Keep at it.

815
00:34:36,447 --> 00:34:38,347
I'm gonna go do
what I gotta go do.

816
00:34:45,155 --> 00:34:48,591
[Sighs]
We need more.

817
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,026
[Whispers]
How're we gonna get more?

818
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,664
Mike?

819
00:34:54,732 --> 00:34:56,166
Is this the building
we were in yesterday?

820
00:34:56,234 --> 00:35:00,471
No rent, no apartment.
That's my code.

821
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:03,875
Uh, yeah.
Before and after.

822
00:35:03,942 --> 00:35:06,244
[Exhales]

823
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:09,047
We need to
go carpet shopping.

824
00:35:11,451 --> 00:35:13,318
I see you found my ad.

825
00:35:13,386 --> 00:35:15,620
Trying to steal
my thunder, Harvey?

826
00:35:15,688 --> 00:35:17,321
Business school 101,

827
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:19,457
you have a crisis,
you acknowledge the problem.

828
00:35:19,525 --> 00:35:21,992
You wanna be Tylenol,
not Toyota.

829
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,862
A little late for you
to acknowledge this is a crisis.

830
00:35:29,534 --> 00:35:30,768
Ladies and gentlemen,

831
00:35:30,835 --> 00:35:33,070
thank you very much
for coming here today.

832
00:35:33,137 --> 00:35:35,572
Quentin Sainz placed this ad

833
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,474
because your lawsuit
made it clear

834
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:41,044
that his drug had side effects
that he didn't know about.

835
00:35:41,112 --> 00:35:43,780
We wanted to know how
widespread this problem was.

836
00:35:43,848 --> 00:35:46,217
We had an
outpouring of response.

837
00:35:46,284 --> 00:35:50,021
Not from people
struggling like yourselves,

838
00:35:50,088 --> 00:35:52,423
but from people desperate
to keep the drug available.

839
00:35:54,627 --> 00:35:56,695
You think we're lying.

840
00:35:56,762 --> 00:35:58,696
You're here because
you think this company

841
00:35:58,764 --> 00:36:00,398
has been hiding things
from you.

842
00:36:00,466 --> 00:36:03,568
And you're right.
They have.

843
00:36:03,635 --> 00:36:06,437
But Quentin wants to come clean.

844
00:36:06,505 --> 00:36:07,872
He wants to show you

845
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,607
exactly what it is
that he's been hiding.

846
00:36:12,344 --> 00:36:15,813
I can't really open it.
I can't hold anything,

847
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:18,883
and I don't know how
much longer I can keep working.

848
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:22,353
It'll get better, it will.

849
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,388
You know it will.

850
00:36:24,456 --> 00:36:27,992
I guess.

851
00:36:28,059 --> 00:36:29,861
I bet my life on it.

852
00:36:33,766 --> 00:36:37,469
It's not fair you
got A.L.S. In the first place.

853
00:36:37,537 --> 00:36:39,938
And it's definitely
not fair you had side effects

854
00:36:40,006 --> 00:36:42,107
from the drug I created
and I didn't.

855
00:36:42,175 --> 00:36:47,679
But now that I know they exist,
I wanna fix them.

856
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:52,117
So that people like you...

857
00:36:52,185 --> 00:36:56,054
And maybe even you,
can have what I have right now.

858
00:36:56,122 --> 00:36:57,823
But he can't.

859
00:36:57,891 --> 00:36:59,992
He can't if he gives you
what you're asking.

860
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,994
We're not saying that
you don't deserve compensation.

861
00:37:03,062 --> 00:37:05,598
Our commitment to you
is this.

862
00:37:05,665 --> 00:37:09,968
We are offering you partial
ownership in his company.

863
00:37:10,036 --> 00:37:12,771
A company that is
trying to save lives.

864
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:15,674
Money isn't going
to help you live longer.

865
00:37:15,742 --> 00:37:18,477
Taking the deal,
and letting Quentin

866
00:37:18,545 --> 00:37:21,013
try and fix the problem
could.

867
00:37:21,081 --> 00:37:22,648
Like it or not...

868
00:37:22,716 --> 00:37:25,318
You're all in the same boat.

869
00:37:25,385 --> 00:37:27,286
Give
Quentin the opportunity

870
00:37:27,354 --> 00:37:30,089
to keep that boat
from sinking.

871
00:37:48,426 --> 00:37:51,061
They really took the offer.

872
00:37:51,129 --> 00:37:52,989
Uh-huh,
Church didn't like it.

873
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,991
But they didn't like Church.

874
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:57,026
They liked you.
Hm.

875
00:37:57,094 --> 00:37:58,895
And me.

876
00:37:58,962 --> 00:38:01,697
[Chuckles]
Who wouldn't?

877
00:38:01,765 --> 00:38:03,298
Oh, your mother was
never a fan.

878
00:38:03,366 --> 00:38:04,866
You wanna know the truth,

879
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:06,501
my father wasn't
much of a fan either.

880
00:38:06,569 --> 00:38:09,371
Now that is a lie
and I know it.

881
00:38:09,439 --> 00:38:11,072
Yeah.
The real truth is,

882
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,774
they'd both take
you over Lisa in a minute.

883
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:24,687
I'm sorry.

884
00:38:24,755 --> 00:38:27,591
I'm sorry too.

885
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:34,698
From now on...
back to no more lies.

886
00:38:34,766 --> 00:38:38,068
Well,
if we're gonna do that...

887
00:38:38,136 --> 00:38:41,238
You remember that time
that your Jag got sideswiped

888
00:38:41,306 --> 00:38:42,606
when it was
parked outside the house?

889
00:38:42,674 --> 00:38:44,475
Yeah.

890
00:38:44,543 --> 00:38:46,410
Yeah, it didn't
exactly go down that way.

891
00:38:50,582 --> 00:38:52,117
I was mad.
[Blusters]

892
00:38:52,184 --> 00:38:53,284
- [Giggles]
- You were mad?

893
00:38:58,624 --> 00:39:00,725
Oh, you brought a sack lunch.
We would've shared.

894
00:39:00,792 --> 00:39:02,693
Amusing.

895
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,228
As was this,
your little lawsuit.

896
00:39:04,296 --> 00:39:05,596
[Chuckles]

897
00:39:05,664 --> 00:39:07,598
Take your sack of presents
and run, kid.

898
00:39:07,666 --> 00:39:08,999
You're in way over your head.

899
00:39:09,067 --> 00:39:11,001
Oh, I think
he'll be just fine.

900
00:39:11,069 --> 00:39:13,637
- Hello, Vivien.
- Hello.

901
00:39:13,704 --> 00:39:15,571
So the rookie
called in the veteran.

902
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:17,673
No, no,
I'm just here to watch.

903
00:39:17,741 --> 00:39:19,408
I love spectator sports.

904
00:39:19,476 --> 00:39:22,244
You enjoy watching the Yankees
destroy a little league team?

905
00:39:22,312 --> 00:39:23,779
David and Goliath
happens to be

906
00:39:23,846 --> 00:39:25,313
one of my favorite stories.

907
00:39:25,381 --> 00:39:29,184
Okay, I'll bite.
What's in the bag?

908
00:39:29,252 --> 00:39:33,522
[Crinkling plastic]

909
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,658
- [Clears throat]
- Hey, hey, what're you doing?

910
00:39:35,726 --> 00:39:37,427
Oh, do you recognize
this carpet?

911
00:39:37,495 --> 00:39:39,062
Make him get that out of here.

912
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,831
This is your
own carpet, Mr. Karinski.

913
00:39:40,898 --> 00:39:42,333
It's from
Frank Carvello's apartment.

914
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,370
Come on.
Feel the fibers, the texture,

915
00:39:46,438 --> 00:39:49,306
it's almost alive.
You brought bedbugs in here.

916
00:39:49,374 --> 00:39:51,909
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That's vandalism, assault.

917
00:39:51,977 --> 00:39:53,945
You know, I'm happy
that you put it that way,

918
00:39:54,012 --> 00:39:56,313
because that's what we're gonna
be charging your client with.

919
00:39:56,381 --> 00:39:57,815
What are you talking about?

920
00:39:57,883 --> 00:40:00,685
He didn't just fail to
eradicate a bedbug infestation,

921
00:40:00,752 --> 00:40:02,653
he actually created one.

922
00:40:02,721 --> 00:40:05,356
Yeah, he pulled the carpet
from one of his old buildings--

923
00:40:05,424 --> 00:40:07,025
carpet that was already
infested--

924
00:40:07,093 --> 00:40:09,460
and then he reinstalled it
in my client's apartment

925
00:40:09,528 --> 00:40:11,663
to drive him out.
That's crazy.

926
00:40:11,731 --> 00:40:13,699
You might wanna warn
your client about perjury.

927
00:40:13,766 --> 00:40:15,968
We've got sworn testimony
from the installer.

928
00:40:16,035 --> 00:40:18,870
And a picture of
the same carpet

929
00:40:18,938 --> 00:40:21,940
from one of his old buildings
before it was renovated.

930
00:40:22,008 --> 00:40:24,176
By the way,
my wife and I really love

931
00:40:24,244 --> 00:40:26,611
what you've
done with the place.

932
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:28,447
So it looks like
we're talking about, what?

933
00:40:28,514 --> 00:40:33,118
Assault, violations of
rental codes, health codes,

934
00:40:33,186 --> 00:40:36,488
and you know, just
basic codes of human decency.

935
00:40:36,556 --> 00:40:38,790
And if a jury in
New York heard all that,

936
00:40:38,858 --> 00:40:40,592
wow, imagine the damages.
Harvey...

937
00:40:40,659 --> 00:40:41,960
Spectate, please.

938
00:40:42,027 --> 00:40:43,594
Just get that carpet
out of here.

939
00:40:43,662 --> 00:40:45,797
So, Vivien...

940
00:40:45,865 --> 00:40:48,100
How am I doing for
my first time?

941
00:40:48,168 --> 00:40:50,135
This still counts as
my first time, doesn't it?

942
00:40:52,806 --> 00:40:55,274
Now let's talk about how much
this is going to cost you.

943
00:41:04,653 --> 00:41:07,923
[Knocking]
Yes?

944
00:41:07,991 --> 00:41:09,291
Just thought
you'd like to know,

945
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:12,360
your case, the pro bono...
I won.

946
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,496
How exciting for you.

947
00:41:14,563 --> 00:41:15,863
But like I said,
it's just a pro bono case,

948
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,232
it's not gonna help your career.

949
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:19,166
I did also manage
to sign 15 new clients

950
00:41:19,234 --> 00:41:21,069
who are all suing
for the same harassment,

951
00:41:21,137 --> 00:41:22,337
and they will be paying.

952
00:41:22,405 --> 00:41:24,639
So you can multiply
this number...

953
00:41:24,707 --> 00:41:28,109
Times 15.

954
00:41:28,176 --> 00:41:29,376
That's not bad for
rookie league.

955
00:41:32,113 --> 00:41:33,747
[Sighs]
Come on.

956
00:41:33,815 --> 00:41:36,149
Tell me that wasn't worth
missing your lunch hour for.

957
00:41:36,217 --> 00:41:38,251
Mm, it makes me
proud to be your wife.

958
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,153
Yeah, wait,
what is that coming up?

959
00:41:40,221 --> 00:41:41,988
Is that our third,
or our fourth anniversary?

960
00:41:42,056 --> 00:41:44,257
It's our fifth.
Doesn't it mean anything to you?

961
00:41:44,325 --> 00:41:46,092
Yeah.
In fact, I think that

962
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,627
we should have
a date night to celebrate.

963
00:41:47,694 --> 00:41:48,961
[Giggles]
You're funny.

964
00:41:49,029 --> 00:41:50,096
Hey.

965
00:41:50,164 --> 00:41:52,999
I'm serious.

966
00:42:00,108 --> 00:42:02,844
I can't date anyone
from the office.

967
00:42:04,847 --> 00:42:07,715
You--
