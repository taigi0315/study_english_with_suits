Original Subtitle Chunk:
--------------------------------------------------
1. [00:07:54.070000-00:07:55.540000] not at the man with the sword.
2. [00:07:55.610000-00:07:57.680000] By the way,
I've set up a meeting
3. [00:07:57.740000-00:07:59.880000] for you and John Dockery
next week.
4. [00:07:59.950000-00:08:01.380000] Dockery?
He's Skadden's biggest client.
5. [00:08:01.450000-00:08:02.450000] Not anymore.
6. [00:08:02.510000-00:08:04.280000] He's looking around.
7. [00:08:04.350000-00:08:05.620000] He plays tennis.
I want you to close him.
8. [00:08:05.690000-00:08:07.050000] Consider it done.
9. [00:08:07.120000-00:08:10.090000] Then you are
officially dismissed
10. [00:08:10.160000-00:08:11.960000] for the evening.
11. [00:08:12.030000-00:08:13.630000] Cheers.
12. [00:08:13.690000-00:08:14.690000] Well, you two seem
to be celebrating something.
13. [00:08:14.760000-00:08:17.030000] Mm-hmm.
We are.
14. [00:08:17.100000-00:08:18.600000] In fact, you are looking
15. [00:08:18.670000-00:08:19.900000] at the best closer
this city has ever seen.
16. [00:08:19.970000-00:08:21.200000] Closer, huh?
17. [00:08:21.270000-00:08:22.600000] Baseball?
Attorney.
18. [00:08:22.670000-00:08:24.100000] I close situations.
19. [00:08:24.170000-00:08:26.010000] Hmm.
So you only care about money?
20. [00:08:26.070000-00:08:27.840000] The truth is,
I do it for the children.
21. [00:08:29.780000-00:08:31.350000] I'm Lisa.
22. [00:08:31.410000-00:08:32.650000] Harvey.
23. [00:08:32.720000-00:08:35.720000] Lisa, I don't normally do this,
24. [00:08:35.790000-00:08:37.390000] but since we are celebrating,
25. [00:08:37.450000-00:08:39.290000] what time do you get off
tonight?
26. [00:08:39.360000-00:08:41.290000] I'm glad you asked.
27. [00:08:41.360000-00:08:45.600000] I get off at ten past
"I'm never going out with you."
28. [00:08:48.170000-00:08:52.270000] I guess you're not the best
closer this city's ever seen.
29. [00:08:55.610000-00:09:03.380000] ♪ ♪
30. [00:09:06.220000-00:09:07.720000] Good morning.
31. [00:09:07.790000-00:09:09.350000] Lisa, this was lovely,
32. [00:09:09.420000-00:09:11.120000] but I'm afraid you have to go.
33. [00:09:11.190000-00:09:12.860000] - Aw.
- I hate to miss a workout,
34. [00:09:12.920000-00:09:15.160000] and I really need
to be in the office by 7:30.
35. [00:09:15.230000-00:09:17.430000] Can't we have breakfast?
36. [00:09:17.500000-00:09:18.930000] You could eat it
off my stomach.
37. [00:09:19-00:09:20.200000] I guess if I skip the gym,
38. [00:09:20.260000-00:09:22.170000] I can still get in by 9:00.
39. [00:09:33.740000-00:09:36.650000] I hear someone's
not taking their pills.
40. [00:09:36.710000-00:09:39.320000] Because they're trying
to poison me.
41. [00:09:39.380000-00:09:41.520000] Grammy, that's crazy.
42. [00:09:41.580000-00:09:42.990000] Dr. shrager gave me her word
43. [00:09:43.050000-00:09:45.490000] she wouldn't poison you
until January.
44. [00:09:45.550000-00:09:47.090000] If she does it before then,
she can't count it
45. [00:09:47.160000-00:09:49.290000] towards next year's quota.
46. [00:09:51.790000-00:09:54.460000] Oh, what did I teach you?
47. [00:09:57.670000-00:10:01.170000] Michael, I'm not gonna be
around forever.
48. [00:10:01.240000-00:10:06.610000] And I want you to stop
with that stuff.
49. [00:10:06.670000-00:10:07.910000] What stuff?
50. [00:10:07.980000-00:10:10.480000] I may be old,
51. [00:10:10.540000-00:10:12.410000] but I'm not an idiot.
52. [00:10:12.480000-00:10:14.620000] I know life has been hard
for you,
53. [00:10:14.680000-00:10:16.120000] but you're not a kid anymore,
54. [00:10:16.180000-00:10:17.890000] and I want you to promise
55. [00:10:17.950000-00:10:20.290000] you're gonna start living up
to your potential.
56. [00:10:25.830000-00:10:27.560000] I promise.
57. [00:10:30.870000-00:10:32.840000] I'm not saying that I haven't
been charmed by Harvey,
58. [00:10:32.900000-00:10:34.670000] but it's just so patronizing
59. [00:10:34.740000-00:10:36.410000] when you say
that he can handle those things
60. [00:10:36.470000-00:10:37.940000] and, "Louis,
you can only handle this."
61. [00:10:38.010000-00:10:39.840000] Jessica, I could have handled
Gerald Tate.
62. [00:10:39.910000-00:10:41.180000] And I told you I disagree.
63. [00:10:41.240000-00:10:43.080000] - Why?
- Because when you put
64. [00:10:43.150000-00:10:44.410000] two bullies
in the same room together,
65. [00:10:44.480000-00:10:46.410000] things generally
don't go so well.
66. [00:10:46.480000-00:10:47.880000] It's 9:30.
Nice of you to show up
67. [00:10:47.950000-00:10:49.750000] two hours after we open
for business.
68. [00:10:49.820000-00:10:51.790000] And I see that you're also
trying to look like a pimp.
69. [00:10:51.850000-00:10:54.650000] My bad, Louis.
I was out late last night.
70. [00:10:54.720000-00:10:55.590000] And when I woke up,
this is the suit
71. [00:10:55.660000-00:10:56.920000] your wife picked out for me.
72. [00:10:56.990000-00:10:58.560000] And that would be funny
73. [00:10:58.630000-00:11:00.360000] if I'd actually been married.
Moving along.
74. [00:11:00.430000-00:11:02.530000] - You're not married?
- Recruiting. Harvey.
75. [00:11:02.600000-00:11:04.230000] Your interviews are set up
for tomorrow.
76. [00:11:04.300000-00:11:05.730000] What?
Why don't we just hire
77. [00:11:05.800000-00:11:07.600000] the Harvard summer associate
douche?
78. [00:11:07.670000-00:11:09.770000] I think if you listen
to the phrasing
79. [00:11:09.840000-00:11:11.770000] of that question,
you'll come up with an answer.
80. [00:11:11.840000-00:11:13.580000] We need people who think
on their feet,
81. [00:11:13.640000-00:11:15.140000] not another clone
with a rod up his ass.
82. [00:11:15.210000-00:11:17.110000] Harvey, the fact
that we only hire from Harvard
83. [00:11:17.180000-00:11:19.050000] gives us a cache
that's a little more valuable
84. [00:11:19.120000-00:11:20.650000] than hiring a kid from Rutgers.
85. [00:11:22.150000-00:11:24.420000] You went to Harvard law.
86. [00:11:24.490000-00:11:26.320000] I'm an exception.
87. [00:11:26.390000-00:11:27.920000] Find me another one.
88. [00:11:27.990000-00:11:29.760000] Can we please skip
the recruiting?
89. [00:11:29.830000-00:11:31.460000] I work better alone anyway.
90. [00:11:31.530000-00:11:33.060000] Well, I would, Harvey,
91. [00:11:33.130000-00:11:35.100000] except all senior partners
get an associate.
92. [00:11:35.160000-00:11:36.970000] It's just a rule.
93. [00:11:37.030000-00:11:39.630000] I'm sorry.
What?
94. [00:11:39.700000-00:11:40.900000] Jessica, I deserve
that promotion.
95. [00:11:40.970000-00:11:42.670000] My billables destroy his.
96. [00:11:42.740000-00:11:45.140000] And I'm here night and day
doing whatever's needed
97. [00:11:45.210000-00:11:46.740000] instead of swanning
in and out of here
98. [00:11:46.810000-00:11:48.480000] whenever I please.
99. [00:11:48.540000-00:11:50.950000] I must admit, he does make me
sound very swan-like.
100. [00:11:51.010000-00:11:52.050000] Harvey,
101. [00:11:52.120000-00:11:53.920000] shut up.
102. [00:11:53.980000-00:11:56.850000] Louis, this is how it is.
103. [00:11:56.920000-00:12:00.190000] All right,
now you two make nice.
104. [00:12:00.260000-00:12:02.690000] Louis, I apologize.
I was out of line.
105. [00:12:02.760000-00:12:06.460000] Now if you'll just let me text
your pretend wife
106. [00:12:06.530000-00:12:09.730000] that I just made senior partner,
I--what?
107. [00:12:09.800000-00:12:11.730000] Your grandmother's
getting worse.
108. [00:12:11.800000-00:12:13.670000] I need to move her to full care
109. [00:12:13.740000-00:12:15.700000] or I'll have to transfer her
to the state facility.
110. [00:12:15.770000-00:12:17.670000] I won't put her
in a state facility.
111. [00:12:17.740000-00:12:20.170000] Then I'm afraid you'll have
to come up with $25,000.
112. [00:12:22.610000-00:12:24.580000] Trevor, I'm in.
113. [00:12:24.650000-00:12:26.980000] One-time deal.
I want 25.
114. [00:12:27.050000-00:12:28.050000] Take it or leave it.
115. [00:12:28.120000-00:12:29.280000] I'll take it.
116. [00:12:29.350000-00:12:30.420000] There's a briefcase in my room.
117. [00:12:30.490000-00:12:31.590000] Pick it up tomorrow,
118. [00:12:31.650000-00:12:33.290000] take it to room 2412
119. [00:12:33.360000-00:12:34.750000] at the Chilton Hotel.
120. [00:12:34.820000-00:12:36.390000] Now you can't go
to a luxury hotel
121. [00:12:36.460000-00:12:38.260000] looking like a delivery guy,
so shave,
122. [00:12:38.330000-00:12:40.160000] comb your hair, buy a suit.
123. [00:12:40.230000-00:12:41.890000] That's a hell
of a lot to ask, man.
124. [00:12:41.960000-00:12:44.330000] Well, I'm not asking you.
I'm paying you $25,000.
125. [00:12:44.400000-00:12:45.360000] Okay?
126. [00:12:45.430000-00:12:48.230000] Yeah, he's in.
127. [00:12:48.300000-00:12:49.600000] Good.
128. [00:12:49.670000-00:12:51.770000] I'm gonna go take a piss.
129. [00:12:57.440000-00:12:58.910000] Key.
130. [00:12:58.980000-00:13:00.110000] 24 hours, we'll know
131. [00:13:00.180000-00:13:02.210000] if this new buyer's a cop.
132. [00:13:02.280000-00:13:03.520000] Why didn't you tell Trevor
he might be sending
133. [00:13:03.580000-00:13:05.080000] his guy into a setup?
134. [00:13:05.150000-00:13:06.080000] Same reason
why I don't tell Gina
135. [00:13:06.150000-00:13:07.320000] I'm banging her sister.
136. [00:13:07.390000-00:13:09.990000] It'll only cause trouble.
137. [00:13:10.060000-00:13:11.360000] What's up?
138. [00:13:11.430000-00:13:13.030000] I'm just gonna take off.
139. [00:13:13.090000-00:13:16.030000] I don't think you should.
140. [00:13:16.100000-00:13:18.070000] Why don't you stay with us
till tomorrow?
141. [00:13:18.130000-00:13:20] Now give me your cell phone.
142. [00:13:20.070000-00:13:21.470000] Give me your phone.
143. [00:13:21.540000-00:13:25.800000] Don't even think
about warning your boy.
144. [00:13:25.870000-00:13:28.340000] 'Cause if these guys are cops,
whoever's holding that weed
145. [00:13:28.410000-00:13:30.210000] is going to jail
for a long time.
146. [00:13:35.880000-00:13:37.380000] Hey.
147. [00:13:37.450000-00:13:39.350000] Hey. God, you scared the hell
out of me.
148. [00:13:39.420000-00:13:40.390000] Sorry.
149. [00:13:40.450000-00:13:44.560000] Look at you.
150. [00:13:44.620000-00:13:46.160000] You look great.
Thanks.
151. [00:13:46.230000-00:13:47.730000] Tell me you decided
to work with Trevor.
152. [00:13:47.790000-00:13:50.560000] Yeah.
Trial basis. Yeah.
153. [00:13:52.770000-00:13:54.440000] What are you doing here?
154. [00:13:54.500000-00:13:57.140000] My mom is coming
by my place later.
155. [00:13:57.210000-00:13:58.270000] And I don't want to mess it up,
156. [00:13:58.340000-00:14:00.210000] so I'm hanging here.
157. [00:14:00.280000-00:14:02.240000] Got to go.
158. [00:14:02.310000-00:14:04.950000] Hey.
Come here.
159. [00:14:07.120000-00:14:09.320000] Mm.
160. [00:14:09.390000-00:14:11.320000] You want to look perfect
on your first day.
161. [00:14:11.390000-00:14:13.190000] Yeah.
162. [00:14:18.260000-00:14:19.830000] I've got to go.
163. [00:14:21.430000-00:14:22.700000] Mm-hmm.
164. [00:14:38.180000-00:14:40.280000] Great. Thanks.
165. [00:14:40.350000-00:14:43.320000] Donna, we're gonna need
to streamline this.
166. [00:14:43.390000-00:14:45.150000] Give each guy a hard time.
