1
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:14,260
Lucille.

2
00:00:14,295 --> 00:00:16,430
Hey!

3
00:00:16,464 --> 00:00:17,794
Hey, it's looking good.

4
00:00:17,828 --> 00:00:19,796
- Tell me you got good news.
- I do.

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,061
Stable shelters' bridge loan
has just been approved.

6
00:00:22,095 --> 00:00:23,730
Harvey pulled
some strings at the bank.

7
00:00:23,764 --> 00:00:25,836
Ah, good to see you, Harvey.

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,642
I figured you was allergic
to manual labor.

9
00:00:27,676 --> 00:00:30,447
Oh, I'll get my hands dirty
if I have to, Lucille.

10
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:32,755
But I believe
charity begins at home.

11
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:34,656
Yeah, and based on
that rolex you wear,

12
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:36,763
I'd say that your favorite cause
is doing pretty good.

13
00:00:36,797 --> 00:00:38,999
We're gonna need
your signature here.

14
00:00:39,033 --> 00:00:41,535
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
15% interest?

15
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,904
They're worried about
stable shelter's solvency.

16
00:00:43,938 --> 00:00:45,071
They're worried?

17
00:00:45,106 --> 00:00:46,773
They should try being
executive director.

18
00:00:46,807 --> 00:00:47,940
If you don't recover the money

19
00:00:47,975 --> 00:00:50,108
that Anthony Mazlo
embezzled from us,

20
00:00:50,143 --> 00:00:51,944
every one of these
projects goes dark.

21
00:00:51,978 --> 00:00:53,679
Unless you got
a spare room or two

22
00:00:53,713 --> 00:00:55,647
for a couple thousand families
in your condo.

23
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,482
I'm not really
a roommate kind of guy.

24
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:58,582
Oh.

25
00:00:58,617 --> 00:01:00,217
Harvey's deposing
Elliot Perkins,

26
00:01:00,252 --> 00:01:02,152
Mazlo's number two,
this afternoon.

27
00:01:02,186 --> 00:01:03,786
Perkins had to have
knowledge of this,

28
00:01:03,821 --> 00:01:05,221
and he's going
to give up his boss.

29
00:01:05,256 --> 00:01:06,925
That's a promise.
Excuse me.

30
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:18,509
Check it out.
Mazlo spent $500 a night

31
00:01:18,543 --> 00:01:21,348
on doggie daycare
on his trip to Greece.

32
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:23,717
Greece.

33
00:01:23,752 --> 00:01:24,718
What?

34
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:27,790
- Oh, nothing.
- Tell me.

35
00:01:27,825 --> 00:01:31,696
My first time was in Greece.

36
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,565
My God, you're picturing that
right now, aren't you?

37
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,869
I have no choice.
I'm a visual person.

38
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:42,077
You two are really adorable.

39
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:44,246
We're 48 hours from trial,
and you're gossiping

40
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,682
like two 12-year-olds
at sleepaway camp.

41
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:53,457
Listen up.

42
00:01:53,492 --> 00:01:56,161
Lucille Jackson's not just the
head of stable shelters, okay?

43
00:01:56,195 --> 00:01:58,231
She also sits
on the board of directors

44
00:01:58,265 --> 00:01:59,766
of several of
our largest clients.

45
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,801
So if we lose this case,

46
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:04,204
I doubt that her generosity's
going to extend to us.

47
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,772
- I would--
- In my office.

48
00:02:05,807 --> 00:02:07,474
Bring the clarity-drilling IPO.

49
00:02:07,508 --> 00:02:10,877
Jerome Jensen's here.
Come on.

50
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:12,879
Lucille's case
is all hands on deck, Harvey.

51
00:02:12,913 --> 00:02:15,047
- You can't just--
- I can, and I am.

52
00:02:15,082 --> 00:02:16,649
I thought we're
working on this together.

53
00:02:16,683 --> 00:02:17,883
Yeah, we are, Louis.

54
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:20,186
Same way a golfer
and his caddy work together.

55
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,654
Be that as it may,

56
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:25,157
we are deposing Elliot Perkins
in 15 minutes, so--

57
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:26,159
Perkins can wait.

58
00:02:26,193 --> 00:02:27,560
Just make sure that my 9 iron

59
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:29,095
is nice and shiny
when I get there.

60
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,298
Okay?
Come on, Mike.

61
00:02:35,504 --> 00:02:36,805
Harvey.

62
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,941
Jerome Jensen, meet Mike Ross.

63
00:02:38,975 --> 00:02:40,109
He's got the latest on the IPO.

64
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:41,443
- Hello, Mike.
- Mr. Jensen.

65
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:43,913
I'm not here to talk
about my business, Harvey.

66
00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:47,116
Looks like my daughter might be
getting into some trouble.

67
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,218
Mildred Wisnewski.

68
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,420
What's Lola doing
with a fake I.D.?

69
00:02:51,455 --> 00:02:53,623
Well, that's what I hope
you can find out.

70
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:55,091
It slipped out of her purse

71
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,259
when she was ordering a drink
at a friend's Bar Mitzvah.

72
00:02:57,294 --> 00:03:00,996
Any idea what it's about?

73
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:05,367
My relationship with Lola's
been rocky for a few years.

74
00:03:05,401 --> 00:03:08,604
If I asked her, she'd just lie.

75
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,906
Truth is, I don't need to know.

76
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:12,976
I just need you
to take care of it.

77
00:03:13,011 --> 00:03:15,880
Thank you.

78
00:03:15,914 --> 00:03:17,548
What the hell is Harvey doing?

79
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,350
He's supposed to be
deposing Elliot Perkins.

80
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:20,451
He's with a client.

81
00:03:20,486 --> 00:03:22,454
I don't care.
We have a deposition.

82
00:03:22,488 --> 00:03:27,225
Don't even try it, Louis.

83
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:28,559
I'm sorry.

84
00:03:28,594 --> 00:03:30,328
Let's-- Let's just start over.
Okay?

85
00:03:30,363 --> 00:03:32,664
- Hi, Donna.
- Hi.

86
00:03:32,698 --> 00:03:34,933
You know I like you, right?

87
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:36,535
But in the firm's food chain,

88
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:39,704
I am a humpback whale,
and you are phytoplankton.

89
00:03:43,576 --> 00:03:46,044
June 3, 1997.

90
00:03:51,751 --> 00:03:53,452
That date means nothing to me.

91
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:56,389
Doesn't it?

92
00:03:56,423 --> 00:03:57,423
Who told you?

93
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,225
Is the important thing
how I know

94
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,160
<i>or that I know?</i>

95
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:02,495
Does Harvey know?

96
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:03,830
He can.

97
00:04:03,864 --> 00:04:05,131
I'm going to pay you.

98
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,067
I just don't have
cash on me right now.

99
00:04:07,101 --> 00:04:08,836
So I'm gonna just tell Norma

100
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,204
to run her old ass
out to the atm

101
00:04:10,238 --> 00:04:12,139
and then bring it back
in a jiff, all right?

102
00:04:12,174 --> 00:04:13,274
I don't want your money, Louis.

103
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:14,275
I just want you to--

104
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,411
I was not here.
I was not here.

105
00:04:16,445 --> 00:04:19,949
I was not here.

106
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:21,384
All right,
let's get started, shall we?

107
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,786
Isn't Harvey Specter
leading this deposition?

108
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:26,188
He sent me.

109
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:28,457
Now, Mr. Perkins,

110
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:31,393
my first question to you is...

111
00:04:31,428 --> 00:04:34,731
Do you sleep well at night?

112
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:36,299
Of course you do,

113
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,336
'cause you have a roof
and a bed and running water,

114
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,305
and by contrast,
thousands of families

115
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:42,739
are gonna be sleeping
on the street

116
00:04:42,774 --> 00:04:45,142
when stable shelters is forced
to suspend their operations,

117
00:04:45,176 --> 00:04:47,778
all because of the money
that you stole.

118
00:04:47,812 --> 00:04:49,080
I never stole anything.

119
00:04:49,114 --> 00:04:50,181
You're Mazlo's number two.

120
00:04:50,215 --> 00:04:52,116
Money was embezzled.
Do you deny that?

121
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,651
- Absolutely.
- Please, Robert,

122
00:04:53,685 --> 00:04:55,986
I know as general counsel
you just basically push paper,

123
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:58,556
but please warn Mr. Perkins
about the penalties of perjury.

124
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,658
Look, I'm not aware
of any perjury.

125
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:02,226
We know about your account
in the Caymans.

126
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:03,961
$20 million.
Are you kidding me?

127
00:05:03,996 --> 00:05:05,996
That transaction
was legitimate.

128
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:08,232
Oh, when I take this public,
you're gonna be disgraced.

129
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,902
Your wife, your children,
your whole family, disgraced.

130
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,504
Would you show my client
some respect--

131
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:16,073
And that transaction
had nothing to do with the firm.

132
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,141
Bullshit.

133
00:05:17,175 --> 00:05:18,642
You either
took your cut from Mazlo,

134
00:05:18,677 --> 00:05:19,943
or it was hush money.

135
00:05:19,977 --> 00:05:21,110
Either way, you're gonna live

136
00:05:21,145 --> 00:05:22,412
the rest of your life
as a pariah,

137
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:23,780
or you give up Mazlo now.

138
00:05:23,814 --> 00:05:25,381
Is this a deposition
or an inquisition?

139
00:05:25,415 --> 00:05:27,583
This is ridiculous.
I can show you the records.

140
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,585
Oh, sure you can.
Because you're the guy

141
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,520
who invented losses
in mortgage-backed securities

142
00:05:31,555 --> 00:05:33,256
when you never even
bought them.

143
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,057
I had no part in that.

144
00:05:35,092 --> 00:05:37,327
But you were aware of it,
and you did nothing about it.

145
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:39,061
Come on, Louis.

146
00:05:39,096 --> 00:05:40,463
Can I get
a glass of water, please?

147
00:05:40,497 --> 00:05:43,466
You can't get any water.
We don't have any.

148
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,701
You give up Mazlo now,
and this all stops.

149
00:05:45,736 --> 00:05:47,036
All right, that's--
That's it.

150
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,037
My client needs a break.

151
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:49,805
We can continue this
in ten minutes.

152
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,942
I'm just getting started.

153
00:05:53,976 --> 00:05:55,677
I don't get it.
She looks so sweet.

154
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:57,345
Don't let the photo fool you.

155
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:58,546
She's less "girl next door"

156
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,281
and more
"girl with the dragon tattoo."

157
00:06:00,315 --> 00:06:01,515
Mm.

158
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,584
Look, my plate's full
with stable shelters.

159
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:05,519
I need you to look
into Jerome's daughter.

160
00:06:05,553 --> 00:06:07,788
Why didn't you just
hire a private investigator?

161
00:06:07,823 --> 00:06:08,990
Because if there's a problem,

162
00:06:09,024 --> 00:06:10,792
an investigator can't fix it.

163
00:06:10,826 --> 00:06:13,028
I'm not just a lawyer
to Jerome, okay?

164
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:17,133
<i>I'm-- I'm more like
Robert Duvall in the godfather.</i>

165
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,102
His consigliere.

166
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:21,304
Okay.
[Clears throat]

167
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,372
What?

168
00:06:22,406 --> 00:06:23,908
Uh, nothing.

169
00:06:23,942 --> 00:06:26,143
Just if you're
his Robert Duvall,

170
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,377
you're coming to me,

171
00:06:27,412 --> 00:06:29,646
so technically
I'm your Robert Duvall.

172
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,416
You're my Fredo.

173
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,719
Fredo?
No.

174
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,325
Robert, what the hell
happened to Perkins?

175
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:47,197
Ask that pit bull of yours.

176
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:48,632
Uh, oh, no, actually.

177
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,301
I prefer a female masseuse?

178
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:53,003
If that--
Can I call you right back?

179
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,638
Right back.
Okay, bye.

180
00:06:54,673 --> 00:06:57,342
Perkins just got
wheeled out on stretcher.

181
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:58,777
Well, he couldn't
handle the heat.

182
00:06:58,811 --> 00:06:59,778
He's probably faking it.

183
00:06:59,812 --> 00:07:00,779
What were you thinking,

184
00:07:00,813 --> 00:07:03,282
starting that deposition
without me?

185
00:07:03,316 --> 00:07:05,117
I don't know. Maybe if
you were doing your jo--

186
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:06,952
- Oh, no.
- What?

187
00:07:06,986 --> 00:07:09,521
It's from Geller.
Perkins wasn't faking anything.

188
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:13,091

Well, he blew f the deposition,

199
00:07:49,973 --> 00:07:51,640
so I was just
picking up the slack.

200
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:53,643
I was letting Perkins sweat.

201
00:07:53,677 --> 00:07:56,012
It was a tactic,
which you completely undermined.

202
00:07:56,046 --> 00:07:58,748
Well, I believe
I made him sweat and then some.

203
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:00,316
Are you actually proud
of what you did?

204
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:01,584
As far as I'm concerned,

205
00:08:01,618 --> 00:08:02,885
whatever happened to that guy

206
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,454
was a result of his own guilt,

207
00:08:04,488 --> 00:08:05,789
and I will not apologize

208
00:08:05,823 --> 00:08:08,725
for deposing a criminal
in a vigorous manner.

209
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,560
Losing Perkins
is a complication.

210
00:08:11,595 --> 00:08:13,396
We're just gonna
have to work harder

211
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,963
to unearth Mazlo's money trail.

212
00:08:14,998 --> 00:08:16,465
As for what happened,

213
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:17,966
I've spoken to the hospital,

214
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:20,803
and cause of death
was a pulmonary embolism.

215
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:21,937
It was nothing you did.

216
00:08:21,971 --> 00:08:24,806
Would it be okay
if I took the credit?

217
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:26,508
Louis, I need
to have a word with Harvey.

218
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:28,877
Okay.

219
00:08:35,952 --> 00:08:38,587
Financial crime
is that man's forte.

220
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:40,455
Yes, he overstepped his rank,

221
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:42,824
but I'm not about to throw
the baby out with the bathwater.

222
00:08:42,858 --> 00:08:44,191
Louis is the bathwater.

223
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:45,493
Believe it or not, Harvey,

224
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:47,529
you can be a real pain
in the ass to work with too.

225
00:08:47,563 --> 00:08:48,997
Oh, I get along
with me just fine.

226
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:51,400
Yes, well, I'm not about
to tell Lucille Jackson

227
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:54,170
that we didn't win because
we couldn't work together.

228
00:08:54,204 --> 00:08:56,472
You need to figure out
how to collaborate with Louis.

229
00:09:05,782 --> 00:09:08,651
So the name
on Lola Jensen's fake I.D.

230
00:09:08,685 --> 00:09:10,185
Wasn't just pulled
from thin air.

231
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:11,653
Belongs to an
assistant controller

232
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:12,921
at clarity drilling.

233
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:14,389
You're telling me this why?

234
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:16,424
You wanted me to look into it.

235
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:18,593
I didn't ask you
to explain the problem to me.

236
00:09:18,627 --> 00:09:20,028
I asked you to fix it for me.

237
00:09:20,062 --> 00:09:22,464
[Sighs] Hey, did Louis
really kill a guy?

238
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:25,466
Is that what the associate
rumor mill's been churning out?

239
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:27,035
Actually,
I think he started it.

240
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:29,337
"Yeah, he also claims
that he's 6'2"

241
00:09:29,372 --> 00:09:31,940
with a full head of hair.

242
00:09:31,975 --> 00:09:35,978
Louis with hair.
That's good.

243
00:09:38,682 --> 00:09:40,216
How'd you get past Donna?

244
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,218
You waited till she peed,
didn't you?

245
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:45,421
I mean, the woman
retains water like a camel.

246
00:09:45,455 --> 00:09:48,824
I see that the, uh,
greatest band of all time

247
00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:50,359
is conspicuously absent.

248
00:09:50,393 --> 00:09:52,494
And who would that be, Louis?

249
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:53,562
Oh, I don't know.

250
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:54,563
A little British band
called queen?

251
00:09:54,597 --> 00:09:55,731
Should have seen that coming.

252
00:09:55,766 --> 00:09:56,999
You know, real musicians,

253
00:09:57,034 --> 00:09:58,534
they don't wear eyeliner.

254
00:09:58,568 --> 00:09:59,969
Oh, really?
Why don't you tell that

255
00:10:00,003 --> 00:10:01,404
to the artist
formerly known as Prince,

256
00:10:01,438 --> 00:10:04,239
who's...
Once again named Prince?

257
00:10:04,273 --> 00:10:05,574
What do you want, Louis?

258
00:10:05,608 --> 00:10:07,475
Well, I think
now that we're working together,

259
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,610
we should set
some ground rules.

260
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:11,179
First rule,
never touch my records.

261
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:13,048
Or anything else
in this office.

262
00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:16,050
Fine.

263
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:18,886
That includes the furniture.

264
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:22,323
I'm trying to build
a rapport with you.

265
00:10:22,357 --> 00:10:23,591
Okay?

266
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,194
I mean, I think our relationship
needs a little work.

267
00:10:26,229 --> 00:10:27,763
Let's hold off
the couples counseling

268
00:10:27,797 --> 00:10:29,131
until our fifth anniversary.

269
00:10:29,165 --> 00:10:31,066
Don't you think?

270
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:34,836
Look, Mazlo's lawyer
moved to push up the trial.

271
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:37,339
They know we need time
to cultivate another witness.

272
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:38,707
Well, I say we bluff.

273
00:10:38,741 --> 00:10:41,410
I mean,
Perkins implicated Mazlo

274
00:10:41,444 --> 00:10:43,044
the minute his lawyer
walked out of the room.

275
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:44,346
That's hearsay, Louis.

276
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,614
Not if it's
a deathbed confession.

277
00:10:45,648 --> 00:10:48,583
Maybe while Geller
was making the 911 call,

278
00:10:48,618 --> 00:10:51,853
I had a little
conversation with Perkins.

279
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:53,722
So you want to lie
about what Perkins said

280
00:10:53,756 --> 00:10:55,057
and how he said it?

281
00:10:55,092 --> 00:10:56,659
Well, what's your brilliant
solution, Harvey?

282
00:10:56,693 --> 00:10:58,260
I'm having the money
in Perkins' account

283
00:10:58,295 --> 00:11:00,363
traced as we speak, and I have
another witness in mind.

284
00:11:00,397 --> 00:11:01,831
I get Anthony Mazlo
across that table,

285
00:11:01,865 --> 00:11:03,099
you know I'll break him.

286
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:04,734
- The way you broke Perkins?
- Yeah, if need be.

287
00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:05,735
You're not hearing me.

288
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:07,370
We need to hold off
on any meeting.

289
00:11:07,404 --> 00:11:08,371
I don't--

290
00:11:08,405 --> 00:11:10,239
That's final, Louis.

291
00:11:22,285 --> 00:11:25,354
Question. Why would someone
named Lola Jensen

292
00:11:25,388 --> 00:11:28,658
ever want to be known
as Mildred Wisnewski?

293
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:30,092
Who are you?

294
00:11:30,127 --> 00:11:32,328
My name's Mike Ross.
I'm a lawyer.

295
00:11:32,363 --> 00:11:34,564
Let me guess.
Pearson Hardman?

296
00:11:37,868 --> 00:11:40,303
You know, forging a government
document like this

297
00:11:40,337 --> 00:11:43,106
after 911
is next to impossible.

298
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,676
God, there must have been
a glitch at the DMV.

299
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,244
Why'd you come here?

300
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:50,512
Your father came to us
'cause he's worried about you.

301
00:11:50,547 --> 00:11:52,114
He's not worried.
He'd be here himself.

302
00:11:52,148 --> 00:11:54,016
He wouldn't have sent
an empty suit.

303
00:11:58,187 --> 00:11:59,621
You don't know anything
about me.

304
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:01,256
I, on the other hand,

305
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,757
know that you used this I.D.

306
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,925
To funnel payments
from clarity drilling

307
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,794
to some fake company
that you set up.

308
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:08,429
Locksley LLC?

309
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:10,464
You're stealing money
from your father's company.

310
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:14,102
Couple million so far.

311
00:12:14,137 --> 00:12:15,170
I don't need to know why,

312
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:16,705
but I do need you
to return it. Now.

313
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,208
Actually,
you do need to know why.

314
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:20,977
This is ground water

315
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:24,214
from clarity's fracking
operation South of Tulsa.

316
00:12:24,248 --> 00:12:26,650
It's got elevated levels
of dibutoxyethanol,

317
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:29,353
methane, and benzene.

318
00:12:29,387 --> 00:12:32,488
This compares samples
taken pre-drilling

319
00:12:32,523 --> 00:12:34,123
to levels taken last week.

320
00:12:34,158 --> 00:12:36,826
How did you get that?
That's classified company data.

321
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,628
Let's just say
I'm good with computers.

322
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:41,397
Wait a minute.
Locksley LLC.

323
00:12:41,431 --> 00:12:44,166
As in Robin of Locksley,
as in Robin hood.

324
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,201
These toxins are known
to cause kidney failure,

325
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:48,103
liver cancer, and infertility.

326
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:50,204
The epa fines
were a slap on the wrist,

327
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:52,106
but the settlement
that your firm

328
00:12:52,141 --> 00:12:53,407
negotiated with the victims--

329
00:12:53,442 --> 00:12:55,343
It doesn't matter
how pure your motives are.

330
00:12:55,377 --> 00:12:57,445
You're committing
a very serious crime.

331
00:12:57,479 --> 00:12:59,114
Threaten all you want.
Okay?

332
00:12:59,148 --> 00:13:01,917
There's no way that my father's
gonna let this go public

333
00:13:01,952 --> 00:13:03,352
right before his IPO.

334
00:13:03,386 --> 00:13:06,222
I'm not giving the money back.

335
00:13:06,257 --> 00:13:08,358
I'm giving it away.

336
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:13,963
In terms of living relatives,
I didn't find anything,

337
00:13:13,998 --> 00:13:15,398
but when I looked into
the estates

338
00:13:15,432 --> 00:13:17,600
of relatives who passed away,

339
00:13:17,634 --> 00:13:20,169
e holding was originally
in the name of the aunt.

340
00:13:20,203 --> 00:13:21,971
Your theory on Perkins
is right.

341
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:23,706
Harvey, what are you doing?

342
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,908
Rachel's services
are under my purview.

343
00:13:25,942 --> 00:13:27,643
Sorry.
I'm gonna change that.

344
00:13:27,677 --> 00:13:30,945
Anthony Mazlo and his attorney
are in the conference room.

345
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,414
At whose invitation?

346
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:35,284
Oh, what,
you think I called 'em?

347
00:13:35,318 --> 00:13:36,385
I-- I didn't.

348
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:38,654
Then Mazlo feels
he has an advantage.

349
00:13:38,688 --> 00:13:42,258
And he's pressing it.

350
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:43,593
Hey, fellas.

351
00:13:43,627 --> 00:13:45,629
Thanks for meeting us
on such short notice.

352
00:13:45,663 --> 00:13:47,965
I figured you'd be on a flight
right now, Mr. Mazlo.

353
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:49,867
Somewhere with no
extradition agreement.

354
00:13:49,902 --> 00:13:51,269
Let's get to the point.

355
00:13:51,303 --> 00:13:53,304
Without Perkins,
you don't have a case.

356
00:13:53,338 --> 00:13:54,538
This report summarizes

357
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:56,706
an internal investigation
we conducted.

358
00:13:56,741 --> 00:13:57,974
What Inez has just handed you

359
00:13:58,008 --> 00:14:00,143
is hard evidence
of fraudulent investments

360
00:14:00,177 --> 00:14:01,578
and fake losses
perpetrated by Perkins.

361
00:14:01,612 --> 00:14:03,713
Guys have a real penchant
for fiction, don't you?

362
00:14:03,748 --> 00:14:05,081
No, he duped all of us.

363
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:08,285
As ceo, he betrayed me
just as much as the investors.

364
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:10,286
We found an offshore account
worth 20 million.

365
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:11,287
Hold on a second.

366
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:12,354
Lucille Jackson trusts you

367
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:13,989
to manage
a $150 million endowment.

368
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:15,158
Perkins takes 20.

369
00:14:15,192 --> 00:14:16,693
Where the hell's
the rest of it?

370
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:17,794
In light of these findings,

371
00:14:17,828 --> 00:14:19,629
we'd like to offer
a settlement.

372
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:21,597
15 million.

373
00:14:21,631 --> 00:14:22,998
Ten cents on the dollar?

374
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:23,999
That's a slap in the face.

375
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:25,700
Well, we advise all our clients

376
00:14:25,735 --> 00:14:27,201
that investments carry risk.

377
00:14:27,236 --> 00:14:29,670
You want a risk-free return,
buy treasury bills,

378
00:14:29,705 --> 00:14:31,405
or, I don't know,
hide your money

379
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,674
under the mattress.

380
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:36,110
While you were writing
the great American novel,

381
00:14:36,144 --> 00:14:38,012
I've been checking facts.

382
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:40,615
The 20 million
that Perkins had overseas

383
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:42,083
was legitimate.

384
00:14:42,117 --> 00:14:45,053
He was innocent.

385
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:47,489
The money your firm embezzled
is still out there,

386
00:14:47,523 --> 00:14:48,823
and this so-called
investigation

387
00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:51,526
isn't worth the paper
it's printed on.

388
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,662
Well, Lucille Jackson
may beg to differ, counselor.

389
00:14:54,697 --> 00:14:56,998
A bridge loan
means she's desperate.

390
00:14:57,032 --> 00:14:59,033
Our offer is non-negotiable.

391
00:14:59,068 --> 00:15:02,170
I won't accept this offer
today or a year from now.

392
00:15:02,204 --> 00:15:04,372
Now since you've all
invited yourselves over,

393
00:15:04,406 --> 00:15:06,007
feel free to see
yourselves out.

394
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,551
So first you attack me for
wanting to lie about Perkins,

395
00:15:16,585 --> 00:15:18,520
and then you turn around,
do the same exact thing?

396
00:15:18,554 --> 00:15:20,221
I wasn't lying.

397
00:15:20,256 --> 00:15:22,524
What are you saying to me?

398
00:15:22,558 --> 00:15:24,092
Harvey, what the hell
are you saying to me?

399
00:15:24,126 --> 00:15:25,894
That Perkins had no
involvement whatsoever?

400
00:15:25,928 --> 00:15:27,495
That's exactly
what I'm saying, Louis.

401
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:29,564
He was innocent.

402
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,691
It's no surprise
that Mazlo low-balled us.

403
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:43,229
I'm just passing along
this offer as a formality.

404
00:15:43,264 --> 00:15:46,566
$15 million
is not insignificant.

405
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:48,001
But now's not the time
to settle.

406
00:15:48,036 --> 00:15:49,703
We have to strengthen our hand.

407
00:15:49,737 --> 00:15:51,805
All right, here's my problem.

408
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,039
Best-case scenario.

409
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:55,742
We go to trial,
the jury awards us a settlement,

410
00:15:55,776 --> 00:15:57,543
obviously Mazlo appeals that.

411
00:15:57,578 --> 00:15:59,378
It's three years
before I see any money,

412
00:15:59,413 --> 00:16:01,147
and my foundation's
long gone by that point.

413
00:16:01,181 --> 00:16:02,648
No, I'm not gonna let Mazlo

414
00:16:02,682 --> 00:16:04,617
pocket the lion's share
of your endowment.

415
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:06,452
I'm not interested
in a pyrrhic victory.

416
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:08,221
Neither are we.

417
00:16:08,256 --> 00:16:11,025
And to prove it, we're gonna
forego our usual fee,

418
00:16:11,059 --> 00:16:13,394
and return to you the money
you've already paid.

419
00:16:13,428 --> 00:16:18,767
I grew up
sleeping in my mama's car.

420
00:16:18,802 --> 00:16:22,505
And in and out of more
halfway houses than I can count,

421
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:26,076
and one thing I realized
is that every penny matters.

422
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,412
So thank you.

423
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,114
What you gonna do?

424
00:16:31,148 --> 00:16:32,949
Perkins may have been innocent,

425
00:16:32,983 --> 00:16:34,584
but he was still
Mazlo's direct report.

426
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,152
I'm gonna find out
what he knew.

427
00:16:36,187 --> 00:16:38,855
Your job is to verify
every detail

428
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,991
of Mazlo's
internal investigation.

429
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:43,928
It is not about the crime now.
It's about the cover-up.

430
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,129
This says Perkins acted alone.

431
00:16:45,164 --> 00:16:46,464
Well, he's
the perfect scapegoat.

432
00:16:46,498 --> 00:16:47,699
He can't defend himself.

433
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:48,933
You want to go to the bathroom?

434
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:51,436
You don't bother coming back.

435
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:54,207
By the way, that goes
for personal phone calls,

436
00:16:54,241 --> 00:16:55,808
emails, and texts.

437
00:16:55,843 --> 00:16:58,144
I detect a whiff of slacking,

438
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:01,749
you are done.
Get it?

439
00:17:01,783 --> 00:17:03,750
You find anything,
I'll be in my office.

440
00:17:07,188 --> 00:17:10,423
Louis. Uh, I'm still
working on Harvey's case.

441
00:17:10,457 --> 00:17:12,791
Jerome Jensen can go
screw himself for all I care.

442
00:17:12,826 --> 00:17:14,192
Well, Harvey
explicitly told me--

443
00:17:14,227 --> 00:17:15,994
I don't care if
a burning bush told you, Mike.

444
00:17:16,028 --> 00:17:18,029
The only commandments
you need to focus on right now

445
00:17:18,063 --> 00:17:21,265
come from me.

446
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,668
There's something wrong
with Louis.

447
00:17:23,702 --> 00:17:25,570
It's not my problem.
I answer to Harvey.

448
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:27,906
Sitting home alone
with your kids, with no job.

449
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,007
Harvey.

450
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:30,476
You solve Jerome's problem yet?

451
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,578
Uh, about to. But I need
your corporate card first.

452
00:17:32,612 --> 00:17:34,113
What for?

453
00:17:34,148 --> 00:17:36,550
Well, I thought you didn't
want me to explain it to you.

454
00:17:36,584 --> 00:17:39,619
You're right.
I don't.

455
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,224
Okay.

456
00:17:46,327 --> 00:17:47,694
It's killing you not knowing

457
00:17:47,728 --> 00:17:49,128
what I'm gonna use this for,
isn't it?

458
00:17:49,163 --> 00:17:50,497
Nope.

459
00:17:50,531 --> 00:17:51,664
Please let me tell you.

460
00:17:51,699 --> 00:17:53,099
If you bring that back to me

461
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:54,200
and it smells like stripper,

462
00:17:54,234 --> 00:17:55,201
you're fired.

463
00:17:55,235 --> 00:17:57,536
[Laughs]

464
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,071
I don't-- I don't go
to places like that.

465
00:18:03,075 --> 00:18:04,108
You had to send someone?

466
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:08,079
Couldn't just call me?

467
00:18:08,114 --> 00:18:09,581
If you wanted this
to be private,

468
00:18:09,615 --> 00:18:10,882
should have just robbed me.

469
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,516
You robbed the company,
I had to involve other people.

470
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,818
Okay.
Why don't we take a seat?

471
00:18:14,852 --> 00:18:17,420
Why are you here?

472
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:19,155
I want to tell you
my side of things.

473
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,390
Okay.

474
00:18:20,424 --> 00:18:21,458
I'm not proud of the fact

475
00:18:21,492 --> 00:18:23,560
that we contaminated
people's water.

476
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:25,095
But we apologized.

477
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,265
We implemented safeguards.

478
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:30,168
We negotiated a payout
that was more than generous.

479
00:18:30,203 --> 00:18:31,270
If that's what you think,

480
00:18:31,304 --> 00:18:33,272
then you are lying to yourself.

481
00:18:33,306 --> 00:18:34,940
I think that
we could keep this civil--

482
00:18:34,975 --> 00:18:36,108
No, she's right.
It's true.

483
00:18:36,143 --> 00:18:37,643
I am lying to myself.

484
00:18:37,678 --> 00:18:39,679
I thought this was a phase,

485
00:18:39,713 --> 00:18:42,081
that it was hormones,
that it would pass,

486
00:18:42,115 --> 00:18:44,183
but the truth is...

487
00:18:44,217 --> 00:18:45,617
I raised a thief.

488
00:18:45,652 --> 00:18:47,653
Okay, I think we're gonna
need a minute. Thank you.

489
00:18:47,687 --> 00:18:48,988
A thief.

490
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:51,190
My research is making the planet
more habitable, okay?

491
00:18:51,224 --> 00:18:54,293
You are making money
destroying it.

492
00:18:54,327 --> 00:18:56,328
You have no respect for me,
that's fine.

493
00:18:56,363 --> 00:18:58,564
But at least
respect the workers.

494
00:18:58,598 --> 00:19:00,065
You're stealing from them too.

495
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,102
You think I'm such a criminal?
Arrest me.

496
00:19:03,136 --> 00:19:05,371
So I organized this so that
you two could clear the air,

497
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:07,106
and it seems we've gotten
off the wrong foot...

498
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:09,109
You know what? It's the same
story as always, dad.

499
00:19:09,143 --> 00:19:13,347
You duck your responsibilities.

500
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:15,416
Lo-- Lola.

501
00:19:21,857 --> 00:19:23,824
What if I paid the company
back with my own money?

502
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:26,126
I don't think that
would be a very good idea.

503
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:27,427
It would make you
a conspirator.

504
00:19:27,462 --> 00:19:29,029
I'm not turning my daughter
into the police.

505
00:19:29,063 --> 00:19:30,564
This is not about
the company image.

506
00:19:30,598 --> 00:19:31,732
Well, the good news is,

507
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:33,166
she hasn't distributed
the money--

508
00:19:33,201 --> 00:19:36,670
The money is irrelevant.

509
00:19:36,704 --> 00:19:40,507
I came to Pearson Hardman
to take care of this.

510
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:43,777
Instead, my daughter and I
are further apart than ever.

511
00:19:48,482 --> 00:19:51,485
I can't imagine
how hard it is right now.

512
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,123
People are saying the most
horrible things about Elliot.

513
00:19:55,157 --> 00:19:57,792
They must think I've gone deaf.

514
00:19:57,827 --> 00:20:00,696
Anthony Mazlo has been
dragging your husband's name

515
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,932
through the mud to make him
a scapegoat, Mrs. Perkins.

516
00:20:03,966 --> 00:20:05,768
I'm here to help.

517
00:20:05,802 --> 00:20:06,769
I don't understand.

518
00:20:06,803 --> 00:20:07,969
You work for the other side.

519
00:20:08,004 --> 00:20:09,904
I work for
a charitable organization

520
00:20:09,938 --> 00:20:12,240
that had all its money stolen.

521
00:20:12,274 --> 00:20:15,008
I'm on the other side of
Anthony Mazlo, not your husband,

522
00:20:15,043 --> 00:20:16,309
and I don't want
to see his memory

523
00:20:16,344 --> 00:20:18,311
painted with the same brush.

524
00:20:18,346 --> 00:20:21,147
What would I have to do?

525
00:20:21,181 --> 00:20:22,481
This isn't the time
or the place.

526
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:25,084
No, it's okay.
What would I have to do?

527
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:26,252
I'd like to know everything

528
00:20:26,286 --> 00:20:28,821
Elliot has ever
told you about Mazlo.

529
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:32,391
Any details would help.

530
00:20:32,426 --> 00:20:34,994
Miss Perkins,
uh, I'm Louis Litt,

531
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:36,195
and I just want to let you know

532
00:20:36,229 --> 00:20:37,663
that I'm going to do
whatever it takes

533
00:20:37,698 --> 00:20:40,032
to clear your husband's name.

534
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:41,634
His name?

535
00:20:41,668 --> 00:20:44,904
My husband would be alive today

536
00:20:44,938 --> 00:20:45,905
if it weren't for you.

537
00:20:45,939 --> 00:20:47,140
Well, we don't know that.

538
00:20:47,174 --> 00:20:49,242
I know what happened
in that room.

539
00:20:49,276 --> 00:20:51,211
Well, at the time,
we didn't have all the facts,

540
00:20:51,245 --> 00:20:55,080
but now we do.

541
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:57,617
I can't believe
that you have the audacity

542
00:20:57,651 --> 00:20:59,518
to come here.

543
00:20:59,553 --> 00:21:03,923
I don't ever want
to see your face again.

544
00:21:03,957 --> 00:21:06,159
And you can forget
about me helping you.

545
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:12,433
What the hell are you doing?

546
00:21:12,467 --> 00:21:14,802
I was deposing the widow,
just like you.

547
00:21:14,836 --> 00:21:18,073
I came here to pay my respects
and initiate a relationship,

548
00:21:18,107 --> 00:21:20,041
not aggravate a grieving woman.

549
00:21:20,076 --> 00:21:21,376
Yeah, I brought flowers.

550
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,279
You just cost us
a potential witness.

551
00:21:24,313 --> 00:21:25,547
Oh, really?

552
00:21:25,581 --> 00:21:28,182
Well, maybe-- Maybe if you shared
your game plan with me--

553
00:21:28,217 --> 00:21:30,317
Oh, the same way that you
shared your game plan with me?

554
00:21:30,352 --> 00:21:33,554
How do you expect her
to react to seeing you?

555
00:21:33,588 --> 00:21:36,155
You need to get
your shit together

556
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,491
and find us a new witness.

557
00:21:48,368 --> 00:21:52,172
[Knock at door]

558
00:21:52,206 --> 00:21:54,374
Lola.

559
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:57,244
Wanted to apologize
for earlier today.

560
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,846
Can I come in?

561
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,149
Uh, yeah.
Of course.

562
00:22:01,183 --> 00:22:04,051
Nice gesture.
Botanical gardens.

563
00:22:04,086 --> 00:22:06,453
Yeah, he said it was a pretty
special place for you guys.

564
00:22:06,487 --> 00:22:09,723
It was.
And then he became ceo.

565
00:22:09,757 --> 00:22:12,292
But I'm not here to reminisce.

566
00:22:12,326 --> 00:22:15,362
I must say I was, uh,
really impressed

567
00:22:15,396 --> 00:22:17,697
you figured out
what I was doing.

568
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:20,733
Especially since you're
not even a real lawyer.

569
00:22:20,768 --> 00:22:22,335
What-- What are you
talking about?

570
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:25,605
I accessed Harvard
law school's alumni directory.

571
00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:28,508
Every class that graduated
for the last ten years.

572
00:22:28,542 --> 00:22:31,877
No record of Mike Ross.
At all.

573
00:22:31,911 --> 00:22:33,879
Yeah, the Dean's office
was supposed to fix that.

574
00:22:33,913 --> 00:22:36,281
They-- They put my name wrong
in the system.

575
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:38,116
I checked your
social security number

576
00:22:38,151 --> 00:22:39,284
against the database.

577
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:41,153
How'd you get my social
security number?

578
00:22:41,188 --> 00:22:44,189
Easily.
Here's the deal.

579
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,493
Leave me alone,
or I expose you.

580
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:59,895
You don't really seem
that worried about this.

581
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:01,663
Threats like hers are a tactic.

582
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:03,899
They're effective
because they distract you

583
00:23:03,933 --> 00:23:05,300
from what you're
supposed to be doing.

584
00:23:05,334 --> 00:23:06,434
Are you crazy?

585
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,270
What we should be doing
is backing the hell off.

586
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:09,371
And how would that go, huh?

587
00:23:09,372 --> 00:23:11,478
"Jerome, you came to
us with the problem,

588
00:23:11,513 --> 00:23:12,640
"we discovered that
your daughter

589
00:23:12,675 --> 00:23:14,308
"stole $2 million
from your company,

590
00:23:14,343 --> 00:23:16,377
and our conclusion is
you're shit out of luck"?

591
00:23:16,411 --> 00:23:18,212
I don't really care
how it would go.

592
00:23:18,247 --> 00:23:19,513
All I care about is my life,

593
00:23:19,548 --> 00:23:21,115
and-- And keeping our secret.

594
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,451
I told you, it's a distraction.

595
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,587
She won't pull that trigger.

596
00:23:25,622 --> 00:23:27,723
Why do you think she hasn't
distributed that money yet?

597
00:23:27,757 --> 00:23:30,292
Why do you think Jerome doesn't
want us to go to the police?

598
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:31,626
I don't know.

599
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,829
It's because they both
want to bury the hatchet,

600
00:23:33,863 --> 00:23:36,498
and if any of that stuff
happens, they can't.

601
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:38,000
Then what?

602
00:23:38,034 --> 00:23:40,102
Figure out a way
to make them reconcile.

603
00:23:40,136 --> 00:23:42,638
It's easy.

604
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:45,006
Yeah.
It's easy.

605
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:47,141
Inez, right?
Louis Litt.

606
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,142
I know who you are.

607
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,244
So is this what you do
for Mazlo?

608
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,345
You clean up his dirty laundry?

609
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,613
Leave me alone.

610
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:54,381
You know, you have
your whole career ahead of you.

611
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,516
Mazlo goes down and you're
part of this cover-up,

612
00:23:56,551 --> 00:23:57,517
no one's gonna hire you.

613
00:23:57,552 --> 00:23:58,752
I can't help you.

614
00:23:58,786 --> 00:24:00,553
Listen, can I just
tell you something, Inez?

615
00:24:00,588 --> 00:24:02,655
In my experience, people respond
to two things, okay?

616
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,757
And that's the carrot
and the stick.

617
00:24:04,792 --> 00:24:05,892
Now, I prefer the stick,

618
00:24:05,926 --> 00:24:07,327
and if you do not help me,

619
00:24:07,361 --> 00:24:09,762
I will devote
my considerable expertise

620
00:24:09,797 --> 00:24:11,564
to sticking it to you.

621
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:13,700
The same way
you stuck it to Perkins.

622
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:21,840
Inez, stop.

623
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:24,410
Let's go with the carrot.

624
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,115
Inez, Harvey Specter.

625
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,484
I appreciate you
coming forward.

626
00:24:33,518 --> 00:24:35,686
I should have done it sooner.

627
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,054
What changed?

628
00:24:37,088 --> 00:24:40,757
I can't be a part
of a company like that anymore.

629
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:43,160
Are you ready to testify
against Anthony Mazlo

630
00:24:43,194 --> 00:24:44,929
in open court?

631
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:46,798
I am.

632
00:24:46,832 --> 00:24:48,733
I assume you've documented
his malfeasance.

633
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:51,303
Because otherwise it's
he said, she said.

634
00:24:54,842 --> 00:24:56,409
The entire paper trail.

635
00:24:56,443 --> 00:24:58,478
From the beginning
all the way to last week.

636
00:25:02,282 --> 00:25:04,450
Harvey asked me to fix
this problem with Lola,

637
00:25:04,484 --> 00:25:07,419
but I can't.

638
00:25:07,453 --> 00:25:11,189
Because your daughter's
not the problem, Mr. Jensen.

639
00:25:11,223 --> 00:25:15,225
You are.

640
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,727
Are you trying to get fired?

641
00:25:16,761 --> 00:25:18,996
No. I'm not.

642
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,964
I'm your attorney.

643
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:22,699
It's my job to give you advice.

644
00:25:22,734 --> 00:25:25,303
But you're her father.

645
00:25:25,337 --> 00:25:26,938
It's your job to raise her.

646
00:25:26,972 --> 00:25:28,273
Now, you can go
to another firm,

647
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:30,142
but there's not a lawyer
in the city

648
00:25:30,176 --> 00:25:31,343
that can do that job for you.

649
00:25:31,377 --> 00:25:34,246
Please don't lecture me
on parenting.

650
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,349
Mr. Jensen, I had a difficult
relationship with my father,

651
00:25:37,384 --> 00:25:39,018
so trust me when I tell you

652
00:25:39,052 --> 00:25:40,653
that Lola wants to forgive you,

653
00:25:40,687 --> 00:25:42,789
but she needs you
to take the first step.

654
00:25:42,823 --> 00:25:44,190
Well, we tried it your way.

655
00:25:44,225 --> 00:25:48,095
We went to lunch, and you saw
how well that worked out.

656
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,531
My daughter's not a child.

657
00:25:50,566 --> 00:25:51,966
She's an adult.

658
00:25:52,001 --> 00:25:54,136
She made these choices
as an adult.

659
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,437
If you just found a way...

660
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,707
You're my lawyer.
This is a legal problem.

661
00:26:00,743 --> 00:26:05,180
My daughter
brought this on herself.

662
00:26:05,214 --> 00:26:08,316
Now, I desperately do not want
her to go to prison.

663
00:26:08,351 --> 00:26:11,053
But if she doesn't
return the money, she will.

664
00:26:15,257 --> 00:26:16,624
Where's Mazlo?

665
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:19,394
He was afraid
to face us himself?

666
00:26:19,428 --> 00:26:20,528
What do you want?

667
00:26:20,562 --> 00:26:23,431
We know about
your entire scheme.

668
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:24,699
What scheme?

669
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:26,601
Oh, the scheme where
Mazlo's laundering money

670
00:26:26,635 --> 00:26:29,070
through Dubai.

671
00:26:29,105 --> 00:26:31,172
How do you know about Dubai?

672
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:32,474
We cultivated another source.

673
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,876
What kind of settlement
are you looking for?

674
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:39,314
One that includes
punitive damages.

675
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:40,749
Send Inez in here, please.

676
00:26:40,783 --> 00:26:42,951
I don't think
you'll find her at her desk.

677
00:26:42,985 --> 00:26:44,118
Why not?

678
00:26:44,153 --> 00:26:48,156
'Cause she agreed
to testify for us.

679
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,859
I doubt that.

680
00:26:55,231 --> 00:26:56,765
When your colleague
approached her,

681
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,900
she came straight to us.

682
00:26:57,935 --> 00:26:59,435
He even tried to bribe me.

683
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,471
He said if
I ratted out Mr. Mazlo,

684
00:27:01,506 --> 00:27:04,508
he'd get me a job as an
assistant to Jessica Pearson.

685
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:07,044
Everything she told you
is a complete fabrication.

686
00:27:07,078 --> 00:27:09,446
There is no Dubai.

687
00:27:09,481 --> 00:27:11,915
I seem to recall
you mentioning something

688
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,018
about penalties for perjury

689
00:27:14,052 --> 00:27:15,552
at our last meeting.

690
00:27:15,587 --> 00:27:20,024
Well, the penalty for bribing
a witness is just as severe.

691
00:27:20,058 --> 00:27:22,960
And we're willing to overlook
that indiscretion

692
00:27:22,994 --> 00:27:24,028
if you convince your client

693
00:27:24,062 --> 00:27:26,163
to take our settlement offer.

694
00:27:26,198 --> 00:27:29,533
Well, our revised
settlement offer.

695
00:27:29,568 --> 00:27:31,469
- Revised?
- Yes.

696
00:27:31,503 --> 00:27:35,206
Exactly half
of what it was before.

697
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:44,929
What the hell
were you thinking?

698
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,130
We needed a new witness.

699
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,731
You didn't think
to look into her story?

700
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,133
I don't know.
Did you look into it?

701
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,534
You were the one
who brought her in.

702
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:51,535
I assumed you had.

703
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,037
Like any halfway
decent lawyer would.

704
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,205
We were under the gun.

705
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:55,840
And I was under
strict instructions

706
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,375
from my golf pro
to get another witness.

707
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,310
<i>No, I told you to get
another witness,</i>

708
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:00,311
not bribe one.

709
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:01,546
That's enough.

710
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,814
As for the threat
against Louis,

711
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,016
no money changed hands.

712
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,317
I'm not concerned with Louis.

713
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,152
He brought your name
into it, okay?

714
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:08,787
The offer was to be
your assistant.

715
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:11,490
Now you're exposed
because of what he did.

716
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:12,491
Is that true?

717
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:13,692
She's an executive assistant

718
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:15,260
to the head of
a major investment firm.

719
00:28:15,295 --> 00:28:17,296
She's not gonna work
for a junior partner.

720
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,297
So you tried to bribe her.

721
00:28:18,331 --> 00:28:19,697
No, it wasn't a bribe, Jessica.

722
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:21,499
It was an incentive.

723
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:22,967
I thought she'd be
more likely to talk

724
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:26,270
if she wasn't worried
about getting fired.

725
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:28,340
I want you to go to Mazlo
and take their offer.

726
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,742
- I'm not ready to do that.
- I'm not either.

727
00:28:30,777 --> 00:28:32,444
I waived Lucille's fee

728
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:33,979
because a certain
senior partner

729
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:35,113
said we'd never go to trial.

730
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:36,915
I said that before
you stuck me with Louis.

731
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:38,116
Not the point.

732
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,651
She can't afford it,
and neither can we.

733
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:40,952
Give me time.

734
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:42,787
Give it to me without Louis,

735
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:44,722
and we'll see who can
afford it and who can't.

736
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,427
You have until
the end of the day.

737
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:51,928
You come up empty,

738
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,197
I'm taking the offer
to Lucille myself.

739
00:28:58,101 --> 00:29:00,436
Jessica.
I went to Perkins--

740
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,338
Not another word.

741
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:07,243
You try something
like that again,

742
00:29:07,277 --> 00:29:10,413
and it will be your last day
at this firm.

743
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,959
You said Jerome
wouldn't pull the trigger.

744
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,527
You were wrong.
He's ready.

745
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:24,961
I don't have time
for that right now.

746
00:29:24,995 --> 00:29:27,163
Harvey, when the police
show up at Lola's doorstep,

747
00:29:27,197 --> 00:29:28,764
we're done.

748
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:30,767
Has she distributed
the money yet?

749
00:29:30,801 --> 00:29:31,935
No, she hasn't,
but she's--

750
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:33,803
She hasn't, and she won't,

751
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:36,706
because what she wants
is her daddy's attention.

752
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,775
Now sit down with me,
and let's deal with this.

753
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:40,042
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

754
00:29:40,077 --> 00:29:42,545
Why don't you tell me
what you need?

755
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:44,213
Mazlo was in Liechtenstein

756
00:29:44,247 --> 00:29:46,815
the day that Lucille's
endowment evaporated.

757
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:47,949
Maybe he was skiing.

758
00:29:47,984 --> 00:29:51,152
Nobody goes to
Liechtenstein for pleasure.

759
00:29:51,186 --> 00:29:52,720
Why don't we subpoena
the bank records?

760
00:29:52,755 --> 00:29:53,788
How many banks can there be?

761
00:29:53,822 --> 00:29:56,257
Place is like
Switzerland on steroids.

762
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:57,558
We'll never see those records.

763
00:29:57,593 --> 00:30:00,161
So what the hell
do you want from me, then?

764
00:30:00,196 --> 00:30:05,133
What did you just say to me?

765
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:07,736
I once suggested
that we hack Harvard's records

766
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:10,740
to cover my ass,
and you laughed at me.

767
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:12,308
And now it turns out
that you were wrong,

768
00:30:12,342 --> 00:30:14,343
and it's about
to cost me my career.

769
00:30:14,378 --> 00:30:16,012
Where are you going?

770
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,614
You told me to fix my case.

771
00:30:17,648 --> 00:30:20,350
Why don't you fix yours?

772
00:30:53,283 --> 00:30:55,818
Hope you came here to tell me
Harvey's backing off.

773
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:58,121
I wish I could, but he's not.

774
00:30:58,155 --> 00:31:00,723
That's too bad.
Had such a promising career.

775
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:01,924
Oh, my God.
God, Lola,

776
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:03,593
you act like you care
about a higher cause,

777
00:31:03,627 --> 00:31:05,027
but of all the companies
that exist,

778
00:31:05,062 --> 00:31:06,395
you chose your dad.

779
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,431
Company that's trying
to make amends for what it did.

780
00:31:08,465 --> 00:31:10,132
Really don't need
to hear another speech

781
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:11,800
from a wannabe suit.

782
00:31:11,835 --> 00:31:14,169
God, you think
I'm your enemy, huh?

783
00:31:14,203 --> 00:31:15,637
Well, I'm not.

784
00:31:15,671 --> 00:31:16,638
I didn't even come here

785
00:31:16,672 --> 00:31:19,440
to talk to you about me
or your father.

786
00:31:19,475 --> 00:31:23,245
New York.
Iowa. Kansas.

787
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,747
40 states that all
have housing projects

788
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:27,915
that will vanish if we don't
find out information

789
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,250
that only you can help us get.

790
00:31:29,284 --> 00:31:31,152
So you can steal money
for your father's company

791
00:31:31,186 --> 00:31:33,154
or you can blow the whistle
on me if you want to,

792
00:31:33,189 --> 00:31:34,389
but if you
really care about people

793
00:31:34,423 --> 00:31:35,390
the way that you claim to,

794
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:37,492
you're gonna do this first.

795
00:31:41,864 --> 00:31:43,732
Are we close?

796
00:31:43,766 --> 00:31:46,634
I'm accessing the banks
through a server in China.

797
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:48,836
Unless you'd rather
me use yours.

798
00:31:48,871 --> 00:31:52,841
- Take your time.
- Done.

799
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,943
All right, there's 16 banks
in Liechtenstein.

800
00:31:54,977 --> 00:31:57,312
This is every account
in every single one of them.

801
00:31:57,347 --> 00:32:00,249
None of the accounts
is listed under Anthony Mazlo.

802
00:32:00,283 --> 00:32:01,250
Forget about the name.

803
00:32:01,284 --> 00:32:03,018
Find an account
with $150 million

804
00:32:03,053 --> 00:32:07,290
embezzled from stable shelters
on that day.

805
00:32:07,324 --> 00:32:09,125
Harvey, it's time.

806
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:11,094
Unless you have something,

807
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:12,296
I'm calling Lucille to settle.

808
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,132
Jessica,
you know how Liechtenstein

809
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:16,534
doesn't respond to subpoenas,

810
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:17,802
so I've responded for them.

811
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:19,270
Just trust me.

812
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:21,806
We've got everything we need
to find Lucille's money.

813
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,775
It's not here.

814
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,611
Sounds like you need more
than just another minute.

815
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:29,313
You need another person.

816
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,548
Someone whose expertise
is financial crime.

817
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:33,249
No. No.

818
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,819
Harvey, bring in Louis.

819
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:38,988
Or I'm calling Lucille.

820
00:32:49,277 --> 00:32:51,611
Donna, I need to talk to Louis.

821
00:32:51,646 --> 00:32:53,013
He's not in his office.

822
00:32:53,047 --> 00:32:55,181
Huh. Norma wouldn't
tell you where he is?

823
00:32:55,216 --> 00:32:58,285
Well, she didn't, um...

824
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:00,720
You didn't ask her, did you?

825
00:33:00,755 --> 00:33:01,888
She gives me the creeps.

826
00:33:01,923 --> 00:33:03,657
Ugh.
You're such a wuss.

827
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:04,791
What did you just say to me?

828
00:33:04,825 --> 00:33:08,762
I think we both know
what I just said.

829
00:33:08,796 --> 00:33:10,864
Norma, where is he?

830
00:33:10,898 --> 00:33:12,732
What?
You're kidding.

831
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:14,568
- What?
- Shh.

832
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,049
I come here
when I need to be alone.

833
00:33:30,084 --> 00:33:32,319
.44 Magnum?

834
00:33:32,353 --> 00:33:34,054
Really?

835
00:33:34,089 --> 00:33:36,056
Feeling lucky today, punk?

836
00:33:36,091 --> 00:33:37,858
You know, I understand

837
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:40,195
that me pissing the bed
on this case

838
00:33:40,229 --> 00:33:42,898
must be really, really
fun for you.

839
00:33:42,932 --> 00:33:46,134
No.
Louis, it's not.

840
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:47,636
The one thing
you and I have in common

841
00:33:47,671 --> 00:33:49,505
is we need to win.

842
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:51,875
I noticed that.

843
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:55,111
I came here because,
even after everything,

844
00:33:55,145 --> 00:33:56,412
we can win.

845
00:33:56,446 --> 00:33:58,647
No.

846
00:33:58,681 --> 00:34:02,083
I can watch while you win.

847
00:34:02,118 --> 00:34:04,453
Louis, I'm not here
to give you shit.

848
00:34:04,487 --> 00:34:06,288
Listen, I respect you.

849
00:34:06,322 --> 00:34:07,689
I bribed a witness.

850
00:34:07,724 --> 00:34:09,158
You incentivized her.

851
00:34:09,192 --> 00:34:10,726
Went to see Perkins' widow.

852
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,128
To apologize.

853
00:34:12,162 --> 00:34:14,164
I killed a man.

854
00:34:14,198 --> 00:34:16,367
That you thought had it coming.

855
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:19,570
I don't think
you heard what I said.

856
00:34:19,604 --> 00:34:21,439
I respect you.

857
00:34:25,077 --> 00:34:27,445
You need my help.

858
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:29,814
I wouldn't phrase it
exactly like that.

859
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:31,916
Well, if you need my help,

860
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,518
you better phrase it
exactly like that.

861
00:34:33,552 --> 00:34:34,685
Okay.
You want me to say it?

862
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,887
I'll say it.

863
00:34:35,921 --> 00:34:37,722
I'm under the gun,
and I need your help.

864
00:34:37,756 --> 00:34:41,159
I've got information that you've
got the financial expertise

865
00:34:41,193 --> 00:34:42,393
to break this case.

866
00:34:42,428 --> 00:34:44,262
Now let's put the gun down
and go get 'em.

867
00:34:47,366 --> 00:34:48,901
Okay.

868
00:34:48,935 --> 00:34:50,435
First just stand over there.

869
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:52,538
Don't push it.

870
00:35:01,247 --> 00:35:02,747
So what was the exact
amount of money

871
00:35:02,782 --> 00:35:04,549
that was lost from
stable shelters' account?

872
00:35:04,584 --> 00:35:05,550
Why?

873
00:35:05,585 --> 00:35:09,888
$152,375,242.18.

874
00:35:13,392 --> 00:35:15,259
I'm good with numbers.

875
00:35:15,294 --> 00:35:16,961
Huh.

876
00:35:16,996 --> 00:35:18,496
All right.
What do you have?

877
00:35:18,531 --> 00:35:20,699
We've compiled a printout
of every account

878
00:35:20,733 --> 00:35:23,069
that had a deposit made
on the day in question

879
00:35:23,103 --> 00:35:25,371
in all of Liechtenstein's
16 banks.

880
00:35:25,405 --> 00:35:30,976
Okay. Well, we are going
to focus on, excuse me...

881
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,144
These five banks.

882
00:35:32,178 --> 00:35:34,312
How can you be sure?

883
00:35:34,347 --> 00:35:35,847
Watch this.

884
00:35:35,881 --> 00:35:37,282
These four banks have a history

885
00:35:37,316 --> 00:35:39,417
of capitulating to subpoenas.

886
00:35:39,452 --> 00:35:40,785
So Mazlo would know.

887
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,588
These six
have U.S. corporate parents,

888
00:35:43,622 --> 00:35:45,790
which would expose their
accounts to federal scrutiny.

889
00:35:45,825 --> 00:35:47,926
Once again, Mazlo would know.

890
00:35:47,961 --> 00:35:50,396
And then the one that he's got
right there is low in reserves,

891
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,398
therefore its solvency's
in question,

892
00:35:52,432 --> 00:35:53,799
and there is no way in hell

893
00:35:53,834 --> 00:35:55,401
that Mazlo would take
his stolen money

894
00:35:55,435 --> 00:35:58,504
and put it into
some shaky bank.

895
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:00,941
So we can be sure.

896
00:36:00,975 --> 00:36:02,276
Every person
who embezzles money,

897
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,510
they do it in their own way,

898
00:36:03,545 --> 00:36:05,312
but the one thing
that they all have in common

899
00:36:05,346 --> 00:36:07,781
is that they never put
all their eggs in one basket.

900
00:36:07,816 --> 00:36:10,551
So we are going to be looking
at a combination of accounts.

901
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,652
Across banks.

902
00:36:11,686 --> 00:36:12,987
Well, I mean,
maybe across banks.

903
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:14,454
Maybe the same bank.

904
00:36:14,489 --> 00:36:15,856
But we're definitely looking
at more than one account.

905
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,123
How do we figure out
which accounts are his?

906
00:36:17,158 --> 00:36:18,525
Because they're all
gonna add up

907
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:19,959
to the same exact
amount of money

908
00:36:19,994 --> 00:36:21,427
that was lost from
stable shelters' account.

909
00:36:21,462 --> 00:36:22,762
Well, how do you know?

910
00:36:22,796 --> 00:36:24,497
When the account was drained,
it had to go somewhere.

911
00:36:24,531 --> 00:36:27,366
What goes out from Lucille's
had to go into Mazlo's.

912
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:28,834
Simple law of mathematics.

913
00:36:28,869 --> 00:36:30,770
So we just have to figure out
a combination of accounts

914
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:35,610
that adds up to...
$152,375,242.18.

915
00:36:35,644 --> 00:36:38,513
I'm good with numbers too.

916
00:36:47,322 --> 00:36:49,257
Thanks for meeting us
on such short notice.

917
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:51,092
Well, I assume you're ready
to take our offer.

918
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,126
I rushed right down.

919
00:36:52,161 --> 00:36:53,528
Well, we just have
a few questions

920
00:36:53,563 --> 00:36:54,796
before we get to any of that.

921
00:36:54,831 --> 00:36:56,464
We didn't agree to answer
any questions.

922
00:36:56,498 --> 00:36:59,834
No, no, Robert, it's okay.
I'm happy to play.

923
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:02,670
Have you ever been
to Liechtenstein, Mr. Mazlo?

924
00:37:02,705 --> 00:37:04,773
You know,
I've been to many places.

925
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:07,475
Among them, Liechtenstein.

926
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,677
Really?
Well, of those many places,

927
00:37:09,712 --> 00:37:11,479
did you open seven
different bank accounts,

928
00:37:11,514 --> 00:37:13,849
the amounts of which add up to
exactly the same amount of money

929
00:37:13,883 --> 00:37:16,518
that disappeared from Lucille
Jackson's endowment fund?

930
00:37:16,553 --> 00:37:18,721
I doubt it.
Uh, what I don't doubt

931
00:37:18,756 --> 00:37:21,024
is that if you trace the money
that went into those accounts,

932
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:22,359
you'll find that it came

933
00:37:22,393 --> 00:37:24,662
from our corporate offices
in Sri Lanka.

934
00:37:24,696 --> 00:37:26,230
It's completely legitimate.

935
00:37:26,265 --> 00:37:27,999
I mean, I'm happy
to show you the records, uh,

936
00:37:28,033 --> 00:37:29,567
whenever you'd like.

937
00:37:29,601 --> 00:37:31,903
That's great.
Isn't that great?

938
00:37:31,937 --> 00:37:34,371
Well, after that,
can you show us the records

939
00:37:34,406 --> 00:37:35,873
of the seven
safety deposit boxes

940
00:37:35,907 --> 00:37:37,875
that you opened at those
same banks the same day?

941
00:37:46,986 --> 00:37:48,086
I don't have to answer that.

942
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,487
This isn't a deposition.

943
00:37:49,521 --> 00:37:52,190
You're so right.
It's more of a presentation.

944
00:37:52,224 --> 00:37:53,391
We could make it a deposition.

945
00:37:53,425 --> 00:37:54,793
- Or trial.
- Up to you.

946
00:37:54,827 --> 00:37:57,062
We have pictures of you
entering those banks.

947
00:37:57,096 --> 00:38:00,565
And we have enough
to crack their subpoenas.

948
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,401
Just a matter of time, Tony.

949
00:38:06,406 --> 00:38:07,806
All right.
What do you want?

950
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,708
What do I wa--?
Well, it's not about me.

951
00:38:09,743 --> 00:38:11,777
It's about Lucille.
She wants your head on a stick

952
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:13,779
but she'll settle
for her money back.

953
00:38:13,813 --> 00:38:18,049
And your resignation.

954
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:19,750
We agree right here,

955
00:38:19,784 --> 00:38:22,353
no criminal prosecution?

956
00:38:25,924 --> 00:38:27,758
Done.

957
00:38:27,793 --> 00:38:32,197
If Lucille doesn't
get her money back today,

958
00:38:32,231 --> 00:38:34,099
nothing's done.

959
00:38:43,176 --> 00:38:44,977
Great.
That's perfect.

960
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:46,311
You are back in business.

961
00:38:46,346 --> 00:38:47,779
The wire transfer
just went through.

962
00:38:47,814 --> 00:38:50,148
Girl, you came through.

963
00:38:50,183 --> 00:38:51,983
That is what we do.

964
00:38:52,017 --> 00:38:54,452
Harvey.
Harvey, get in here.

965
00:38:54,487 --> 00:38:56,888
Lucille wants
to thank you in person.

966
00:38:56,922 --> 00:38:59,190
Always got time for gratitude.

967
00:38:59,225 --> 00:39:01,026
Harvey,
you didn't let me settle,

968
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,694
and I appreciate your tenacity.

969
00:39:02,728 --> 00:39:04,329
Truth is,
I didn't do this on my own.

970
00:39:04,363 --> 00:39:05,530
Have you met Louis Litt?

971
00:39:05,564 --> 00:39:06,898
You guys are doing
such good work.

972
00:39:06,932 --> 00:39:08,166
I just want you to know it.

973
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,502
Have I told you how valuable
you are to this company?

974
00:39:10,536 --> 00:39:12,370
'Cause you're not.
I'm just kidding.

975
00:39:12,404 --> 00:39:15,107
Janice, I want you to take
the rest of the day off

976
00:39:15,141 --> 00:39:16,875
because you're so good.
And I really mean it.

977
00:39:16,909 --> 00:39:19,544
Harold, 9:30.
Tequila shots.

978
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:21,780
You and me. Sharp.
Be there.

979
00:39:25,785 --> 00:39:27,286
Thank you.

980
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:29,522
- All right.
- See you later.

981
00:39:33,861 --> 00:39:37,230
Louis. Luiz.

982
00:39:37,265 --> 00:39:38,298
What's up?

983
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:40,234
What were you
just doing in there?

984
00:39:40,268 --> 00:39:41,535
What?
I was just...

985
00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:43,270
Let me guess.
You were cutting me out.

986
00:39:43,304 --> 00:39:45,472
- What are you talking about?
- The little impromptu meeting

987
00:39:45,506 --> 00:39:46,806
you just had
with Jessica and Lucille

988
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:48,274
that you conveniently
left me out of.

989
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:49,576
I didn't leave you
out of anything.

990
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:50,877
I mean,
I thought we were a team.

991
00:39:50,911 --> 00:39:52,245
I thought this was the start
of something, but I--

992
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,548
Now I see the truth
all too clearly.

993
00:39:54,582 --> 00:39:57,584
Louis, I was walking by,
and they called me in.

994
00:39:57,618 --> 00:40:00,486
Yeah, just in time to take
the credit for what I did.

995
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:03,022
I didn't do that.

996
00:40:03,056 --> 00:40:05,057
Wouldn't even think
of doing that.

997
00:40:05,091 --> 00:40:06,959
But you know what?

998
00:40:06,994 --> 00:40:10,029
You would, and that's
your problem right there.

999
00:40:17,905 --> 00:40:20,875
[Types on keyboard]

1000
00:40:28,117 --> 00:40:30,251
Got your email about Mazlo.

1001
00:40:30,285 --> 00:40:33,187
Not a bad way
for Locksley LLC to go out.

1002
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:35,222
Looks like the
firm owes you one.

1003
00:40:35,256 --> 00:40:37,391
<i>Think you owe me one.</i>

1004
00:40:44,165 --> 00:40:48,302
Whoa.

1005
00:40:48,337 --> 00:40:49,837
Is this...
The real thing?

1006
00:40:49,872 --> 00:40:51,405
Yeah.

1007
00:40:51,439 --> 00:40:53,941
Told the Dean's office
you'd lost yours,

1008
00:40:53,975 --> 00:40:55,409
and they were happy to oblige

1009
00:40:55,443 --> 00:40:57,945
for one of their top graduates.

1010
00:40:57,979 --> 00:41:01,281
I don't know if
you're awesome or terrifying.

1011
00:41:01,316 --> 00:41:04,618
Also I added a layer
of protection for you.

1012
00:41:11,057 --> 00:41:13,859
Uh, the Harvard law school
alumni database?

1013
00:41:16,663 --> 00:41:19,263
It's all there.
Your name, class rank,

1014
00:41:19,298 --> 00:41:21,299
social security number.

1015
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:24,235
You do realize you just
made me party to a crime, right?

1016
00:41:24,269 --> 00:41:25,702
Can always call 'em up,

1017
00:41:25,737 --> 00:41:27,237
report it as a glitch.

1018
00:41:27,272 --> 00:41:30,474
Let me guess.
Untraceable.

1019
00:41:30,508 --> 00:41:32,409
I'm not saying
you won't get caught,

1020
00:41:32,444 --> 00:41:35,680
but it won't be because
your story doesn't check.

1021
00:41:38,883 --> 00:41:41,452
Hey, um...

1022
00:41:41,487 --> 00:41:43,321
Thank you.

1023
00:41:43,355 --> 00:41:45,123
Seriously.

1024
00:41:45,157 --> 00:41:46,724
You're right.

1025
00:41:46,759 --> 00:41:48,960
Working things out with my dad.

1026
00:41:48,994 --> 00:41:50,628
Yeah.

1027
00:41:50,663 --> 00:41:53,030
Not the empty suit
I thought you were.

1028
00:42:00,638 --> 00:42:02,305
Who was that?

1029
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:04,440
Uh, client's daughter.

1030
00:42:04,475 --> 00:42:05,842
Really?
It's kind of late.

1031
00:42:05,876 --> 00:42:07,777
What's she doing
at the office at this hour?

1032
00:42:07,811 --> 00:42:11,015
You know, she was, uh,
just thanking me.

1033
00:42:11,049 --> 00:42:12,383
- Thanking you.
- Mm-hmm.

1034
00:42:12,417 --> 00:42:14,485
How'd she do that?

1035
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,554
Easily.

1036
00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:18,190
She bought me
two tickets to Greece.

1037
00:42:18,224 --> 00:42:21,307
- Not interested.
- We leave Tuesday.

1038
