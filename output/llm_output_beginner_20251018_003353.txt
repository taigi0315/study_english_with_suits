Original Subtitle Chunk:
--------------------------------------------------
1. [00:24:05.160000-00:24:06.730000] Which is right
around the corner,
2. [00:24:06.790000-00:24:08.030000] and you know what I tell him?
Clifford Watkins?
3. [00:24:08.090000-00:24:09.700000] Excuse me.
4. [00:24:09.760000-00:24:10.760000] Can I help you?
5. [00:24:10.830000-00:24:12.500000] Jonathan atwater.
6. [00:24:12.570000-00:24:14.130000] I work for Dean wormer
in the admissions office.
7. [00:24:14.200000-00:24:16.400000] Yes, of course.
What can I do for you?
8. [00:24:16.470000-00:24:18.170000] Well, the Dean
personally sent me down here
9. [00:24:18.240000-00:24:20.470000] to invite you
to a small cocktail hour
10. [00:24:20.540000-00:24:24.510000] for some of
our more realistic candidates.
11. [00:24:24.580000-00:24:26.810000] And we'd like to keep
this sort of thing discreet,
12. [00:24:26.880000-00:24:29.080000] so if you'd subtly hand me
your name tag,
13. [00:24:29.150000-00:24:32.380000] you can proceed
directly to the Dean's office.
14. [00:24:32.450000-00:24:34.350000] Congratulations.
15. [00:24:38.260000-00:24:40.490000] Harvard law
is the oldest law school
16. [00:24:40.560000-00:24:42.160000] in the country and boasts
17. [00:24:42.230000-00:24:44.700000] the most successful graduates
in the world.
18. [00:24:44.760000-00:24:47.930000] Currently, we are six
of nine supreme court justices
19. [00:24:48-00:24:50.540000] and, of course, the president
of the United States.
20. [00:25:40.680000-00:25:42.350000] Uh, hi, good morning.
21. [00:25:42.420000-00:25:43.380000] I'm here to see--
Have a seat.
22. [00:25:49.890000-00:25:52.390000] Thank you.
23. [00:26:09.710000-00:26:11.140000] Mike Ross?
24. [00:26:11.210000-00:26:13.340000] Hi, I'm Rachel Zane.
25. [00:26:13.410000-00:26:15.410000] I'll be giving you
your orientation.
26. [00:26:15.480000-00:26:18.550000] - Wow. You're pretty.
- Good. You've hit on me.
27. [00:26:18.620000-00:26:20.950000] We can get it out of the way
that I am not interested.
28. [00:26:21.020000-00:26:22.090000] No, I'm sorry.
I wasn't hitting on you.
29. [00:26:22.150000-00:26:23.150000] Trust me.
30. [00:26:23.220000-00:26:24.760000] I've given dozens of these,
31. [00:26:24.820000-00:26:26.690000] and without fail,
whatever new hotshot it is
32. [00:26:26.760000-00:26:28.060000] thinks that,
because I'm just a paralegal,
33. [00:26:28.130000-00:26:29.830000] that I will
somehow be blown away
34. [00:26:29.890000-00:26:31.260000] by his dazzling degree.
35. [00:26:31.330000-00:26:33.560000] Let me assure you, I won't.
36. [00:26:33.630000-00:26:37.100000] I was.
I was hitting on you.
37. [00:26:37.170000-00:26:38.940000] You were.
Take notes.
38. [00:26:39.010000-00:26:40.210000] I'm not gonna repeat myself.
39. [00:26:40.270000-00:26:43.580000] I love you.
40. [00:26:43.640000-00:26:46.610000] The firm operates
on a chain of command model.
41. [00:26:46.680000-00:26:48.220000] Harvey's
your commanding officer.
42. [00:26:48.280000-00:26:50.080000] However, Louis Litt,
he oversees all associates,
43. [00:26:50.150000-00:26:51.720000] so you'll also answer to him.
44. [00:26:51.790000-00:26:53.520000] What do you think about Harvey?
45. [00:26:53.590000-00:26:55.290000] People are in awe of him.
46. [00:26:55.360000-00:26:57.020000] They say he's the best closer
there is,
47. [00:26:57.090000-00:26:58.360000] but I have very little contact
with him,
48. [00:26:58.430000-00:26:59.560000] so I don't know.
49. [00:26:59.630000-00:27:01.930000] And what about Louis Litt?
50. [00:27:02-00:27:07.070000] Let's continue with your tour.
51. [00:27:07.130000-00:27:09.300000] Hey, Becky.
You are glowing.
52. [00:27:09.370000-00:27:10.900000] I wonder why that is.
Oh, yeah.
53. [00:27:10.970000-00:27:13.240000] It's the day
they announce my promotion.
54. [00:27:13.310000-00:27:14.810000] Jimmy, have you lost weight?
55. [00:27:14.880000-00:27:16.940000] Steve-O.
56. [00:27:17.010000-00:27:19.680000] Looking like a guy
who came to work.
57. [00:27:19.750000-00:27:21.980000] Excuse me,
why are you scratching off
58. [00:27:22.050000-00:27:23.320000] the senior off my door?
59. [00:27:23.390000-00:27:25.320000] I got a work order
to take it off.
60. [00:27:25.390000-00:27:27.320000] - Who issued the work order?
- My supervisor.
61. [00:27:27.390000-00:27:29.320000] Why did he issue
the work order?
62. [00:27:29.390000-00:27:31.330000] If I knew that,
I'd be his supervisor.
63. [00:27:31.390000-00:27:33.190000] You seem
to be enjoying yourself.
64. [00:27:33.260000-00:27:35.600000] I haven't enjoyed myself
since 2004.
65. [00:27:35.670000-00:27:37.430000] Donna!
66. [00:27:37.500000-00:27:40] Someone's trying to have
a little fun with me here.
67. [00:27:40.070000-00:27:42.700000] Jessica wants to see you
in her office.
68. [00:27:42.770000-00:27:44.470000] Now.
69. [00:27:44.540000-00:27:50.340000] And finally,
this is where you'll live.
70. [00:27:50.410000-00:27:52.180000] Wow.
71. [00:27:52.250000-00:27:54.350000] I gave you that for a reason.
You haven't taken one note.
72. [00:27:54.420000-00:27:55.580000] - That's because--
- Because you were
73. [00:27:55.650000-00:27:57.220000] too busy ogling me to listen
74. [00:27:57.290000-00:27:58.520000] to a word I've said?
75. [00:28:01.220000-00:28:03.020000] Partners' offices
anchor the wings.
76. [00:28:03.090000-00:28:05.660000] Fifth floor's research,
sixth is security.
77. [00:28:05.730000-00:28:08.360000] All work gets billed,
even if it's finding an address.
78. [00:28:08.430000-00:28:09.730000] I answer to Harvey
79. [00:28:09.800000-00:28:11.400000] and Louis Litt,
and, judging by the way
80. [00:28:11.470000-00:28:13.170000] you responded to my questions,
81. [00:28:13.240000-00:28:15.840000] I should admire Harvey
and I should fear Louis.
82. [00:28:15.910000-00:28:17.540000] You have been here
for five years,
83. [00:28:17.610000-00:28:18.970000] and just because I outrank you
84. [00:28:19.040000-00:28:20.140000] does not mean
I have the authority
85. [00:28:20.210000-00:28:21.380000] to command your services.
86. [00:28:21.450000-00:28:22.810000] Oh, it's also pretty clear
87. [00:28:22.880000-00:28:24.250000] that you think you're too smart
88. [00:28:24.310000-00:28:25.380000] to be a paralegal.
89. [00:28:25.450000-00:28:27.750000] You know what nobody likes?
90. [00:28:27.820000-00:28:29.490000] Nobody likes a showoff.
91. [00:28:29.550000-00:28:32.860000] You used the word "ogling."
92. [00:28:32.920000-00:28:35.030000] When do I get to see Harvey?
93. [00:28:35.090000-00:28:37.330000] Gerald Tate fired the firm.
94. [00:28:37.400000-00:28:39.530000] So you're taking
my promotion away.
95. [00:28:39.600000-00:28:42.400000] You know, most firms would put
you in front of the bar
96. [00:28:42.470000-00:28:44.030000] and have your license stripped.
97. [00:28:44.100000-00:28:45.840000] You lied to a client,
and he figured it out.
98. [00:28:45.900000-00:28:48.240000] I lied to him to get him
to do the right thing
99. [00:28:48.310000-00:28:49.810000] and honor his goddamn contract.
100. [00:28:49.880000-00:28:51.080000] And you didn't seem
to mind so much
101. [00:28:51.140000-00:28:52.380000] when you thought
I got away with it.
102. [00:28:52.440000-00:28:54.580000] But you didn't get away
with it.
103. [00:28:54.650000-00:28:57.020000] And I can't justify handing you
a promotion
104. [00:28:57.080000-00:28:58.380000] on the same day that you lose
a huge client.
105. [00:28:58.450000-00:29:01.020000] One client doesn't make a firm.
106. [00:29:01.090000-00:29:02.520000] I don't know if you've noticed,
107. [00:29:02.590000-00:29:04.890000] but we're in the middle
of an economic meltdown.
108. [00:29:04.960000-00:29:06.330000] Companies
aren't exactly lining up
109. [00:29:06.390000-00:29:08.190000] to spend money
on attorneys right now.
110. [00:29:08.260000-00:29:11.300000] And, you know, Gerald might
have forgiven the lying
111. [00:29:11.360000-00:29:13.630000] had you not humiliated him.
112. [00:29:13.700000-00:29:16.100000] But you did,
and you need to accept that.
113. [00:29:19.270000-00:29:22.170000] Jessica, if you hadn't done
as much for me as you have,
114. [00:29:22.240000-00:29:24.210000] I'd be heading for the door.
115. [00:29:24.280000-00:29:26.940000] If I hadn't done as much
for you as I have,
116. [00:29:27.010000-00:29:28.810000] I'd be throwing you
out the window.
117. [00:29:28.880000-00:29:32.920000] But, Harvey,
no more shenanigans.
118. [00:29:32.980000-00:29:35.820000] You do one more thing
that isn't straight as an arrow,
119. [00:29:35.890000-00:29:37.890000] and instead
of covering your ass,
120. [00:29:37.960000-00:29:39.420000] I will put you
in front of the bar myself.
121. [00:29:43.230000-00:29:45.130000] - Mike.
- Hey.
122. [00:29:45.200000-00:29:47.700000] Who's ready
for a great first day?
123. [00:29:47.770000-00:29:49.600000] I'm gonna have to let you go.
124. [00:29:49.670000-00:29:50.640000] - What?
- I just got reamed
125. [00:29:50.700000-00:29:52.240000] for lying to a client,
126. [00:29:52.310000-00:29:53.910000] and if they find out
that I lied about you
127. [00:29:53.970000-00:29:55.240000] going to Harvard,
they'll take away my license.
128. [00:29:55.310000-00:29:56.510000] You what?
129. [00:29:56.580000-00:29:59.080000] Not now, Donna.
130. [00:29:59.150000-00:30:00.650000] Look, I have to put
my own interests
131. [00:30:00.710000-00:30:02.150000] above yours.
It's nothing personal.
132. [00:30:02.210000-00:30:04.750000] You're fired.
133. [00:30:04.820000-00:30:08.220000] Wait, so you're worried
that if I stay,
134. [00:30:08.290000-00:30:11.560000] then they might find out
that you lied about me
135. [00:30:11.620000-00:30:13.960000] and you'll lose your license.
136. [00:30:14.030000-00:30:16.230000] But if you fire me,
then I could tell them
137. [00:30:16.300000-00:30:17.860000] that you lied about me,
138. [00:30:17.930000-00:30:19.430000] and you'd definitely lose
your license.
139. [00:30:19.500000-00:30:22.070000] Are you telling me that
140. [00:30:22.140000-00:30:23.600000] if I throw you under the bus,
141. [00:30:23.670000-00:30:25.040000] you're gonna drag me with you?
142. [00:30:25.110000-00:30:27.070000] You put your interests
above mine,
143. [00:30:27.140000-00:30:30.640000] and I'm just putting mine
back up next to yours.
144. [00:30:32.780000-00:30:33.850000] You're rehired.
145. [00:30:36.350000-00:30:38.650000] So should I--
all right.
146. [00:30:38.720000-00:30:41.190000] Here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna give me back
147. [00:30:41.250000-00:30:42.550000] my promotion,
and that's the last
148. [00:30:42.620000-00:30:43.720000] we're gonna talk about this.
149. [00:30:43.790000-00:30:45.420000] And why is that?
150. [00:30:45.490000-00:30:47.260000] Because if you don't,
I'm gonna go across town
151. [00:30:47.330000-00:30:49.090000] and join Rick Peterson.
152. [00:30:49.160000-00:30:51.060000] I'm gonna approach every client
I've ever closed,
