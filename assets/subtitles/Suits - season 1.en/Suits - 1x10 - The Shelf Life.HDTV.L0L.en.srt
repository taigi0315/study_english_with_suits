Harvey called late last night,

164
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,924
some big emergency,

165
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,192
and Mike ended up staying
the night.

166
00:06:21,226 --> 00:06:22,826
Actually, could you
help me out.

167
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:24,195
I'm running so late to work.

168
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:25,463
Sure.

169
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:26,798
Oh, my God.
Thank you.

170
00:06:26,832 --> 00:06:27,966
Oh.

171
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,967
[Giggles]
Thanks.

172
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:30,468
- Thank you.
- Okay.

173
00:06:30,503 --> 00:06:31,903
Oh!

174
00:06:31,937 --> 00:06:34,305
And can you tell Mike that
I left the key under the mat?

175
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,873
Absolutely.

176
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:37,274
Thank you so much, Rachel.

177
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:40,444
- You're welcome.
- You're amazing.

178

[Clears throat]

179
00:06:53,424 --> 00:06:55,425
Ahem.

180
00:06:59,196 --> 00:07:00,530
Uh!

181
00:07:00,565 --> 00:07:01,531
I'm up.
I'm up.

182
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:02,966
Your girlfriend stopped by.

183
00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:04,735
Dropped that off for you.

184
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:06,036
Girlfriend?

185
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,504
You guys move
in together already?

186
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:09,105
What?
No.

187
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,241
We--she's not my--
why do you care?

188
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:12,375
I don't.
What--

189
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,410
what was the big emergency
last night?

190
00:07:14,445 --> 00:07:15,979
Um, Harvey.

191
00:07:16,013 --> 00:07:18,181
He's firing some big vp from our
accounting firm this morning.

192
00:07:18,216 --> 00:07:19,749
Stan Jacobson?

193
00:07:19,784 --> 00:07:22,052
Yeah, why?
You know him?

194
00:07:22,086 --> 00:07:23,821
No, he was just checking in
at reception when I got there.

195
00:07:23,855 --> 00:07:25,122
What?

196
00:07:25,156 --> 00:07:27,258
Oh, my God!
I got to change.

197
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:29,827
I will let him know
that you will be right there.

198
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:33,197
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

199
00:07:42,806 --> 00:07:44,473
Performance numbers,
HR guidelines,

200
00:07:44,508 --> 00:07:46,041
severance quotes,
and Stan's in the waiting room.

201
00:07:46,076 --> 00:07:47,276
Did you sleep here
last night?

202
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,777
I wouldn't exactly
call it sleeping.

203
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:50,112
Where'd you get that suit?

204
00:07:50,147 --> 00:07:51,915
Uh, Rachel.

205
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:54,251
No, I mean Jenny gave it
to Rachel downstairs.

206
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:55,585
She slept over last night.

207
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,888
Jenny did, not Rachel.

208
00:07:57,923 --> 00:07:59,591
Do I really need to be here
when you fire this guy?

209
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,192
You want to learn how
it's done, right?

210
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:03,529
I read this guy's employment
records, Harvey.

211
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:05,631
He's smart, talented,
loyal.

212
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:06,632
Oh, and you feel bad
for him.

213
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:07,800
I'm shocked.

214
00:08:07,835 --> 00:08:10,470
Where's my smoking gun?

215
00:08:10,504 --> 00:08:11,771
Background check that
confirmed Stan lied

216
00:08:11,806 --> 00:08:12,839
about his credentials.

217
00:08:12,873 --> 00:08:15,075
It never came through.

218
00:08:15,109 --> 00:08:17,411
On it.

00:08:17,446 --> 00:08:20,047
Okay.

Um, could you help me
with something?

I need to get this fax
for Harvey and it's--

Good morning.

00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:27,455
Good morning.
He needs a--

225
00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:28,456
You can tell,
can't you?

226
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,625
I bet you everybody can.

00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:36,831
You...wax your eyebrows?

230
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:39,334
I was with the most beautiful
woman last night.

[Scoffs]

Uh, she wax your eyebrows?

233

We did a lot of things
last night

234
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,441
and waxing wasn't
one of them,

235
00:08:46,476 --> 00:08:48,310
if you know what I mean.

236

Oh, God.

00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:51,580
Uh, well, that's great.
I'm here to ask--

238
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,281
Her name's Charisse
and we have so much in common.

239
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:55,551
And Mike,
there was like this--

240
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:56,819
there was like this,
"mmm."

241
00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:57,953
Mm-mm.

242
00:08:57,988 --> 00:08:59,254
- Like a "mmm."
- Mm-mm.

243
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,322
Like a chemical thing
would happen

244
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:01,857
when our bodies would touch.

245
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:03,491
No, I really don't want to
have this conversation with you.

246
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:04,693
Oh, come on.
We're both guys, right?

247
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:06,795
Little locker room talk
around the office.

248
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:08,196
I mean, that creates
a little male bonding.

249
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,430
That's crazy.
I just heard my name.

Did you hear that?

just one second, okay?

of the security firm

a background check you guys did.

to see Harvey.

at somebody's numbers.

I cannot stop.

327
00:11:39,983 --> 00:11:41,284
[Chuckles]

328
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:42,952
Yeah, I know how valuable
your time is.

329
00:11:42,987 --> 00:11:45,188
I <i>do</i> do the books.

330
00:11:45,222 --> 00:11:47,357
And speaking of which,
your assistant tells me

331
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:49,892
you wanted to go over something
from your last audits.

332
00:11:49,927 --> 00:11:53,429
I could really use a water.

333
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:56,365
Stan, we're not here to go
over any accounting business.

334
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,535
You're here because
you're being let go.

335
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:00,669
What?

336
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:02,071
It's not gonna feel
that surprising

337
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:04,539
when you understand why.

338
00:12:04,574 --> 00:12:06,041
The firm looked into your
background recently.

339
00:12:06,075 --> 00:12:07,942
They know you lied about
passing the CPA exam.

340
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:11,379
You were hired because of your
outstanding credentials

341
00:12:11,413 --> 00:12:15,216
and the reality is
they never existed.

342
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,888
I've been there
for nine years.

343
00:12:20,922 --> 00:12:22,957
My work has been
nothing but--

344
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:24,158
[scoffs]

345
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:25,459
I mean, why would this
even matter now?

346
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:27,394
You have been committing fraud
your entire career.

347
00:12:27,428 --> 00:12:28,862
The liability it presents--

348
00:12:28,897 --> 00:12:30,397
No!
I don't accept this.

349
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:31,598
Okay, take a deep breath.

350
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:33,300
Once you go over
the severance numbers,

351
00:12:33,334 --> 00:12:35,301
you'll see that we've been
more than fair.

352
00:12:35,335 --> 00:12:36,703
[Scoffs]

353
00:12:36,737 --> 00:12:38,872
Fair?

354
00:12:38,906 --> 00:12:41,107
You think this is fair?

355
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:43,643
We understand how difficult
this must be, Stan.

356
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:45,011
How you must feel right now.

357
00:12:45,046 --> 00:12:48,414
You have no idea what
I feel right now.

358
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:50,417
Just so I'm clear--

359
00:12:50,451 --> 00:12:53,520
you're not denying what we're
presenting you with?

360
00:12:53,554 --> 00:12:57,791
You mean that I lied
back when Drybeck hired me?

361
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:04,098
No.

362
00:13:04,132 --> 00:13:05,366
But I'm not some
scam artist either.

363
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,601
I did go to college.

364
00:13:06,635 --> 00:13:09,037
I just...
couldn't afford to graduate.

365
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:10,204
No one ever
questioned it before

366
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:15,877
because I'm that good
with numbers.

367
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:18,780
Then they find out
all of a sudden.

368
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:21,882
They didn't.

369
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:24,552
This background check
is five years old.

370
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:26,554
What?

371
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:28,189
That doesn't make sense.

372
00:13:28,223 --> 00:13:30,190
Is this the original?

373
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:31,925
Yeah.

374
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:37,666
So Tori knew...
all this time?

375
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,735
This is the same thing
that happened to Paula.

376
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:41,737
- Who?
- Paula.

377
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:43,205
Discovered some
undisclosed income,

378
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,474
the books weren't adding up,
she brought it to me.

379
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:46,943
The next thing I know,
she is gone.

380
00:13:46,977 --> 00:13:48,378
I asked Tori about it,
then I start

381
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:49,646
getting shut out of meetings.

382
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,780
They're trying
to hide something

383
00:13:50,814 --> 00:13:52,315
and they're firing me
so they can.

384
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:54,150
Hey,
where are you going?

385
00:13:54,184 --> 00:13:55,284
I'm not signing
some agreement.

386
00:13:55,318 --> 00:13:56,552
Are you kidding me?

387
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,054
I'm getting railroaded!

388
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,822
- Should I go after him?
- No.

389
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:04,492
You've done enough already.

390
00:14:07,674 --> 00:14:09,175
So you let him leave?

391
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:10,743
Physically restraining someone

392
00:14:10,778 --> 00:14:12,612
is not in my job description.

393
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:14,548
Well, what about
your associate,

394
00:14:14,582 --> 00:14:16,450
the one who shared
the background check?

395
00:14:16,484 --> 00:14:19,020
That was a confidential
internal document.

396
00:14:19,054 --> 00:14:20,121
Stan should have never
seen it.

397
00:14:20,156 --> 00:14:22,090
Why did you even have it?

398
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:23,959
You didn't expect us to fire
him without proof, did you?

399
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:26,728
Tori's right.
Stan shouldn't have seen it.

400
00:14:26,762 --> 00:14:28,162
Then I'm guilty
of being thorough.

401
00:14:28,197 --> 00:14:29,764
Hey, I still don't understand
why you haven't

402
00:14:29,798 --> 00:14:30,965
told us the whole truth.

403
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:32,933
I mean, if you knew
five years ago,

404
00:14:32,968 --> 00:14:34,434
why'd you make it sound like
this is something recent?

405
00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:36,436
Because it only came
to my attention two days ago.

406
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,804
Then who ordered
the background check?

407
00:14:37,838 --> 00:14:40,273
It's routine.
You check with human resources.

408
00:14:40,307 --> 00:14:42,408
Is it routine
for human resources

409
00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:45,410
to keep something from
the CEO for half a decade?

410
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:47,112
What are you insinuating?

411
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:49,581
I think what Harvey
is saying is given

412
00:14:49,616 --> 00:14:53,018
how quickly we tried
to accomplish this,

413
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:54,319
some of the details
might have gotten lost.

414
00:14:54,354 --> 00:14:56,322
What was also lost
is that Stan

415
00:14:56,356 --> 00:14:58,258
never signed
the severance package,

416
00:14:58,292 --> 00:15:00,393
which included
the confidentiality agreement,

417
00:15:00,428 --> 00:15:01,661
which means if he decides
to make waves,

418
00:15:01,696 --> 00:15:04,064
the whole point of avoiding
negative publicity--

419
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:05,766
Harvey will
track down Stan

420
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,502
and make sure that he signs
the severance package

421
00:15:08,536 --> 00:15:11,505
and the confidentiality
agreement today.

422
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:14,609
You have my word.

423
00:15:14,643 --> 00:15:16,077
Thank you.

424
00:15:16,111 --> 00:15:18,113
Of course.

425
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:26,821
It's allight, Tori.

426
00:15:26,856 --> 00:15:29,190
She's lying.

427
00:15:29,225 --> 00:15:30,191
She knew about Stan.

428
00:15:30,226 --> 00:15:31,626
She's known for a long time.

429
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,094
And that matters to us why?

430
00:15:33,128 --> 00:15:34,762
Because she's taking
advantage of us.

431
00:15:34,796 --> 00:15:36,430
We are being manipulated
into firing

432
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:38,966
one of her employees and told
not to ask questions.

433
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,367
Well, I have questions.

434
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:43,203
And the answer is ten.

435
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:45,939
As in $10 million per year--

436
00:15:45,973 --> 00:15:49,443
the amount of business Drybeck
generates for this firm.

437
00:15:49,477 --> 00:15:52,580
Which means you have
to finish what you started.

438
00:15:52,614 --> 00:15:56,351
Find Stan and get him
to sign those documents.

439
00:15:56,385 --> 00:15:57,819
Oh, and as far as
I'm concerned,

440
00:15:57,854 --> 00:16:00,022
that little associate of yours
iso blame for all of this.

441
00:16:00,056 --> 00:16:01,190
That was an honest mistake.

442
00:16:01,224 --> 00:16:02,692
He knowingly revealed

443
00:16:02,726 --> 00:16:04,694
the client's
confidential document.

444
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:08,498
That is not a mistake.

445
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:10,699
How many more chances
are you gonna give that kid?

446
00:16:10,734 --> 00:16:13,402
Oh, I didn't realize
we were keeping score.

447
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:14,637
But if that's the case,
I still think

448
00:16:14,671 --> 00:16:26,547
he's coming out ahead.

449
00:16:26,582 --> 00:16:28,416
Whatever you're doing,
stop.

450
00:16:28,451 --> 00:16:29,951
Wait, you're gonna want
to see this.

451
00:16:29,986 --> 00:16:32,588
Paula O'Neil, the former Drybeck
employee that Stan mentioned,

452
00:16:32,622 --> 00:16:34,657
she filed a wrongful
termination suit

453
00:16:34,691 --> 00:16:35,825
that mysteriously went away.

454
00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:40,330
Really?
Let me see that.

455
00:16:40,364 --> 00:16:44,201
Come with me.

456
00:16:44,235 --> 00:16:45,502
Wait.

457
00:16:45,536 --> 00:16:46,737
Do you not think something
funny's going on?

458
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:47,804
You know what?

459
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,405
Here's what I think
is going on.

460
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,406
You're sympathizing with Stan
because you think he's you.

461
00:16:50,441 --> 00:16:51,741
That doesn't mean that--

462
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:52,942
You need to learn something
from what just happened,

463
00:16:52,976 --> 00:16:55,077
not the least of which
is how anyone,

464
00:16:55,112 --> 00:16:57,179
no matter how valuable,
can be let go.

465
00:16:57,213 --> 00:16:58,847
I can chalk up
what happened with Stan

466
00:16:58,881 --> 00:17:01,516
to youthful exuberance,
but Jessica can't.

467
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,784
So if you want to work here,
you better go home now,

468
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:05,019
because if she sees you--
- Wait, wait.

469
00:17:05,053 --> 00:17:06,086
Is she gonna fire me?

470
00:17:06,121 --> 00:17:07,488
This habit of you
empathizing

471
00:17:07,523 --> 00:17:09,524
with every client,
it's not getting you anywhere.

472
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:11,759
You want to work
in this firm?

473
00:17:11,794 --> 00:17:13,695
You need to deal in facts,
evidence,

474
00:17:13,729 --> 00:17:15,464
information that can hold up.

475
00:17:15,498 --> 00:17:18,768
That's what a real lawyer does.

476
00:17:35,686 --> 00:17:38,988
Stan.

477
00:17:39,022 --> 00:17:40,656
Did you follow me here?

478
00:17:40,691 --> 00:17:42,291
Doesn't take a sleuth
to figure out

479
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:45,260
that your next step would be
to see another lawyer.

480
00:17:45,294 --> 00:17:47,362
Bopal and Williams.

481
00:17:47,396 --> 00:17:50,165
They're a good firm.
Not the friendliest bunch.

482
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,333
They called you.

483
00:17:51,368 --> 00:17:52,535
That is against lawyer-client
privilege.

484
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:53,936
No one's breaking any laws,
okay?

485
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,471
My assistant has a network
of other assistants

486
00:17:56,506 --> 00:17:58,006
that tell her anything
she wants to know,

487
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,475
like when someone calls
for an emergency appointment.

488
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:02,043
You forgot this when you left.

489
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:03,678
I said I'm not
signing anything.

490
00:18:03,713 --> 00:18:05,280
It's nothing to sign.

491
00:18:05,314 --> 00:18:06,681
It's a lawsuit.

492
00:18:06,716 --> 00:18:09,518
You worked for Drybeck
for 9 years,

493
00:18:09,552 --> 00:18:12,654
oversaw 80 clients,
filed hundreds of tax returns,

494
00:18:12,689 --> 00:18:13,989
and fought 27 audits.

495
00:18:14,023 --> 00:18:17,259
Now, in light of your recently
discovered fraud,

496
00:18:17,293 --> 00:18:19,160
all of that can now
be called into question.

497
00:18:19,194 --> 00:18:23,130
Therefore, you are being sued
for nine years back pay,

498
00:18:23,165 --> 00:18:26,334
plus any expenses incurred to
mitigate the damage you've done.

499
00:18:26,368 --> 00:18:29,437
This is--

500
00:18:29,471 --> 00:18:31,205
this would bankrupt me.

501
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,808
Or you can take
what's behind door number two.

502
00:18:37,245 --> 00:18:39,213
- It's Aberdeen.
- Who?

503
00:18:39,248 --> 00:18:40,715
It's not a "Who."
It's a "What."

504
00:18:40,749 --> 00:18:42,183
Drybeck is doing business
with them

505
00:18:42,217 --> 00:18:43,384
and I think that's where
the problem lies.

506
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:44,686
You don't get it,
okay?

507
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,454
I'm only leaving with
one of these,

508
00:18:46,488 --> 00:18:48,189
and if it's
the lawsuit,

509
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:49,757
the first thing your friends
upstairs

510
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:51,659
are gonna ask you for
is a big, fat retainer.

511
00:18:51,694 --> 00:18:53,528
And when you tell them
that Harvey Specter

512
00:18:53,562 --> 00:18:54,896
is the one that's suing you,

513
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:56,931
you're gonna watch the color
drain from their faces.

514
00:18:56,966 --> 00:19:01,503
Now what would you
like to do?

515
00:19:01,537 --> 00:19:04,338
[Knock on door]

516
00:19:04,373 --> 00:19:06,207
This is not cool.

517
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:07,675
You leave me in
your apartment all night

518
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:09,110
and say you're gonna
be right back.

519
00:19:09,144 --> 00:19:11,045
You don't even thank me
for dropping off your suit.

520
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:13,314
I had a bad day, Jenny.

521
00:19:13,348 --> 00:19:14,482
So you couldn't call me?

522
00:19:14,516 --> 00:19:15,749
I almost got fired, okay?

523
00:19:15,784 --> 00:19:17,851
What happened?

524
00:19:17,886 --> 00:19:21,154
It--it's not worth
explaining.

525
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:22,856
Okay.

526
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:24,024
I need to find evidence

527
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:25,626
that our accounting firm
is up to something,

528
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,363
so I found this woman who filed
a wrongful termination suit

529
00:19:28,397 --> 00:19:30,298
against them, but then
she referred me to her lawyer.

530
00:19:30,332 --> 00:19:31,599
Did you call them?

531
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:32,868
Yeah, but they're
this huge firm.

532
00:19:32,902 --> 00:19:34,069
Unger and Macy.

533
00:19:34,104 --> 00:19:35,904
They wouldn't take my call.

534
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:37,240
Why not?

535
00:19:37,274 --> 00:19:38,341
There's
a confidentiality clause

536
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,009
in the settlement, for one.

537
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:41,545
So?

538
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:45,149
So it means that they can't
share details like that.

539
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:46,283
You know,
I thought all lawyers

540
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,018
secretly shared that stuff.

541
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:52,155
You're all in the same club,
right?

542
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,223
What?

543
00:19:53,257 --> 00:19:54,491
That's not a dumb thing
to assume.

544
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:55,559
No, no, no, no.

545
00:19:55,593 --> 00:19:59,462
That's not dumb at all,
because...

546
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:00,796
We all are in the same club.

547
00:20:00,831 --> 00:20:03,632
Unger and Macy have almost
as many Harvard grads

548
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:04,933
as we do,
which means--

549
00:20:04,968 --> 00:20:06,702
They're gonna be
at the mixer tonight.

550
00:20:06,736 --> 00:20:08,738
And there are two things
that lawyers love to do.

00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,211
- Hi.
- Hi.

553
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:17,080
Uh, Mike Ross,
class of 2011.

554
00:20:17,114 --> 00:20:18,548
Ross.

555
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,750
Sorry, I don't have you on here.

556
00:20:19,784 --> 00:20:20,818
Do you have your I.D.?

557
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:21,952
I can run it through
the computer.

558
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,187
Uh, my Harvard I.D.?

559
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,690
What did you say your name
was again?

560
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:29,160
Michael Ross
of Pearson Hardman.

561
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:31,463
Boy, you think they ask Harvey
for his I.D.

562
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:33,365
when he comes to this place?

563
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,466
Harvey Specter?

564
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,203
You work with Harvey Specter?

565
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,771
Uh, yeah, yes.

566
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,106
I'm his associate.

567
00:20:41,141 --> 00:20:42,875
I can call him if you like.

568
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,780
Just don't tell him
I gave you any trouble, okay?

569
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:47,948
Welcome.

570
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:50,084
Thank you.

571
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:51,952
Mmm.

572
00:20:51,987 --> 00:20:53,955
Oh, God.
I'm never gonna survive this.

Deep breaths.
You'll be fine.

574
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:10,673
Hey.

575
00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:12,007
I saw the signed severance
papers on my desk.

576
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:14,943
- Thank you.
- And I also left word for Tori.

577
00:21:14,977 --> 00:21:16,144
Yes, we spoke.

578
00:21:16,178 --> 00:21:17,578
She's relieved,
but I wouldn't go so far

579
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:19,313
as to say completely forgiving.

580
00:21:19,348 --> 00:21:21,816
You ever heard
of Aberdeen Solutions?

581
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,084
Drybeck listed them
as a consultant firm.

582
00:21:24,118 --> 00:21:26,253
They bill us every month
for their management services.

583
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:27,922
Okay.

584
00:21:27,956 --> 00:21:29,256
What does that mean?

585
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,359
- Check with accounting.
- I did.

586
00:21:31,393 --> 00:21:33,761
They can only tell me
how much we pay them,

587
00:21:33,796 --> 00:21:35,797
so I called Aberdeen directly.

588
00:21:35,831 --> 00:21:37,399
It's an automated
answering system.

589
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:40,035
I left six messages.
No returns.

590

Something just doesn't
feel right.

Are you saying you want
to investigate our client?

593
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,443
They're also our accountants.

594
00:21:48,477 --> 00:21:51,880
And Tori is also a friend.

595
00:21:51,914 --> 00:21:53,748
Harvey, if you got caught--

596
00:21:53,782 --> 00:21:58,019
I wouldn't get caught.

597
00:21:58,053 --> 00:22:03,091
I am explicitly telling you
not to do this.

598
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,492
Well, then I'll let you know
what I don't find

599
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:09,029
after I don't look into it.

600
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:23,638
Hey, should we get the rest
of the 2010 grads

601
00:22:23,673 --> 00:22:25,273
with us for a pic?

No, no.

Oh, you know what?

Maybe I'm thinking about
somebody else.

for me too.

What?

618
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:02,244

So...this is quite
a surprise.

649
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:22,093
Who'd ever think that you and
I would on a double date?

650
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,262
- Excuse me?
- Oh, come on.

651
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,597
You had to notice when you
walked in the room.

652
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,098
She's absolutely gorgeous.

653
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,767
And she's completely infatuated
with your girlfriend.

654
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,168
Ah.

655
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,437
Come on.

656
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,604
Come on, I'll introduce you
to her.

657
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,840
Charisse, honey...

658
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,875
uh, this is one
of my associates, Mike Ross.

659
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,343
Oh, so nice to meet you.

660
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:41,145
And I'm in love with your date.

661
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:42,546
Seriously.

662
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,347
She's just been telling me about
her work with monkeys.

663
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:45,849
It's fascinating.
Huh?

664
00:24:45,883 --> 00:24:47,884
So really,
they're as smart as us?

665
00:24:47,918 --> 00:24:49,719
Oh, smarter.

666
00:24:49,753 --> 00:24:52,822
I never had a chance
with him.

667
00:24:52,856 --> 00:24:54,724
I need to use
the ladies' room.

668
00:24:54,758 --> 00:24:57,393
Would you excuse me?

669
00:24:57,427 --> 00:24:59,229
Monkeys aren't smarter
than humans, sorry.

670
00:24:59,263 --> 00:25:02,299
That depends on which humans
you're talking about, I guess.

671
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,435
- What?
- Huh?

672
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,203
Name of case and rough date?

673
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,306
Aberdeen versus
Paula O'Neill,

674
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,475
say six months ago.

675
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,477
Oh, let's see.

676
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,013
Says here that they were
listed as a subsidiary

677
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:17,048
of Drybeck in a wrongful
termination suit.

678
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,549
That's it.
That's what I'm looking for.

679
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,818
I can't print this out.
I'll get tagged.

680
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,421
Come around.
Take a look.

681
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,522
Is that what you're after?

682
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,256
Yeah, that's it.

683
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:31,394
But what's that?
[Keyboard clicking]

684
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,463
That links to another
court filing

685
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,031
in relation to Aberdeen.

686
00:25:35,065 --> 00:25:37,401
Click on it.

687
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,470
Says here that they filed
for dissolution...

688
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:41,205
earlier today.

689
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,307
The whole company?

690
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:44,042
That's what it says.

691
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,444
They're officially shut down.

692
00:25:45,478 --> 00:25:50,049
I'm gonna need
one more favor.

693
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:51,684
I think it's great
that you found someone

694
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:53,052
not in law who works out
in the real world.

695
00:25:53,087 --> 00:25:54,754
Why do you say that?

696
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:56,789
Because I'm stuck
in a suit all day

697
00:25:56,824 --> 00:25:58,424
or an office or a courtroom.

698
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:00,092
I think it'd be nice
to be in nature.

699
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:01,426
Don't you, Mike?

700
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:02,761
Well, I love that
you're a lawyer.

701
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:08,633
In fact, I'd love to see
where you work sometime.

702
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,801
You would?

703
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,803
I'm not feeling so well
all of a sudden.

704
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:13,971
- No.
- Yeah.

705
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,072
You think we can go?

706
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:16,374
- Yeah.
- Right now?

707
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,608
Now.
Yeah.

708
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:18,843
- So great to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you.

709
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:19,844
Have good night.

710
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,147
- Bye.
- Bye.

711
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:24,216
Okay, why didn't you
do that sooner?

712
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,653
Because...
I had to get this first.

713
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:29,288
That's the guy, right?
From the firm.

714
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:30,490
That's his employee I.D.

715
00:26:30,524 --> 00:26:32,058
- He gave this to you?
- No, I stole it.

716
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:34,260
What?

717
00:26:34,295 --> 00:26:36,596
Listen, you could spend all
night trying to get to the guy

718
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:39,165
or you could just go into
his firm yourself and look.

719
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:40,299
Come on.

720
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:41,400
Let's go.

721
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:45,504
[Siren wails in distance]

722
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:51,243
Yeah, I can barely keep
my eyes open myself.

723
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:54,012
Filing briefs sucks.

724
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:56,581
[Electronic beep]

725
00:27:19,648 --> 00:27:22,142
You actually came.

726
00:27:22,143 --> 00:27:25,210
You must be Harvey Specter.

727
00:27:25,245 --> 00:27:27,336
"Joe," was it?

728
00:27:27,337 --> 00:27:28,871
Your friend fill you in on
the deal that's on the table?

729
00:27:28,905 --> 00:27:31,306
Let me just get it straight.

730
00:27:31,341 --> 00:27:32,908
You caught him rifling
through some files,

731
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,409
and in lieu of calling
the police,

732
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,444
you want me to pay you off?

733
00:27:35,478 --> 00:27:37,345
I never said that.

734
00:27:37,379 --> 00:27:38,546
He did.

735
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,348
Oh, that's great.

736
00:27:40,382 --> 00:27:42,517
This way, if I level
a charge of extortion,

737
00:27:42,551 --> 00:27:44,218
it's hearsay, huh?

738
00:27:44,252 --> 00:27:45,853
Ten years working
for a law firm,

739
00:27:45,887 --> 00:27:47,554
you learn a thing or two,
which is good,

740
00:27:47,588 --> 00:27:49,722
'cause you sure as hell don't
make a lot of money doing it.

741
00:27:49,757 --> 00:27:51,191
Somehow I think you're
getting by fine.

742
00:27:51,225 --> 00:27:53,627
Just saying, on the level
you guys play at,

743
00:27:53,661 --> 00:27:56,396
espionage happens all the time,
which is why I know

744
00:27:56,431 --> 00:27:58,199
you'll do anything
to protect your secrets.

745
00:27:58,233 --> 00:28:02,003
Well actually, Joe Speena,
of 2561 Clover Lane,

746
00:28:02,037 --> 00:28:04,372
Astoria, Queens,
I think we all would.

747
00:28:04,406 --> 00:28:06,740
Like those tax returns
you filed jointly

748
00:28:06,775 --> 00:28:09,743
for the last six years while
no longer living with your wife.

749
00:28:09,778 --> 00:28:11,812
You know, the IRS
can destroy you for that.

750
00:28:11,846 --> 00:28:15,015
You think you're the first
person to try to extort me, Joe?

751
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:16,582
'Cause that's the level
I play at.

752
00:28:16,617 --> 00:28:18,785
Now...You're a security guard

753
00:28:18,819 --> 00:28:20,620
who likes to take risks.

754
00:28:20,654 --> 00:28:21,754
I like that.

755
00:28:21,788 --> 00:28:22,922
So here's what we're
gonna do.

756
00:28:22,956 --> 00:28:24,924
This here's
a generous donation

757
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:27,093
to Joey junior's
little league team.

758
00:28:27,128 --> 00:28:28,695
Now, if it gets to them,
it gets to them.

759
00:28:28,729 --> 00:28:30,330
If it doesn't,
it doesn't.

760
00:28:30,364 --> 00:28:32,332
But the next time we talk,

761
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:35,101
it's gonna be me
who wants a favor.

762
00:28:39,507 --> 00:28:41,442
Officer.

763
00:28:41,476 --> 00:28:43,277
Do I really
need to pay you back?

764
00:28:43,311 --> 00:28:45,879
Let's start
with an explanation.

765
00:28:45,914 --> 00:28:47,548
You said I needed
to find evidence,

766
00:28:47,582 --> 00:28:48,715
so I went to find some.

767
00:28:48,749 --> 00:28:50,250
By breaking into
another law firm?

768
00:28:50,284 --> 00:28:52,385
Is that really worse than
paying off a security guard?

769
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,120
Okay, first of all,
I didn't pay him off.

770
00:28:54,154 --> 00:28:55,588
Second of all,
if I hadn't paid him off,

771
00:28:55,623 --> 00:28:58,291
you'd be in jail right now.

772
00:28:58,325 --> 00:28:59,626
You think I might
be right about Stan.

773
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,294
No, I never said
you were wrong.

774
00:29:01,328 --> 00:29:03,329
I said we needed evidence.

775
00:29:03,363 --> 00:29:05,598
But did you find something?

776
00:29:05,632 --> 00:29:09,369
Drybeck bought
a shelf company 13 months ago.

777
00:29:09,403 --> 00:29:11,304
What's a shelf company?

778
00:29:11,338 --> 00:29:13,940
It's a corporation
that exists only on paper,

779
00:29:13,974 --> 00:29:16,509
so its owners can hide
their assets.

780
00:29:16,544 --> 00:29:17,510
Isn't that a shell company?

781
00:29:17,545 --> 00:29:19,179
No, it's a shelf company.

782
00:29:19,213 --> 00:29:21,881
Okay, take a shell company,
give it a bank account,

783
00:29:21,915 --> 00:29:23,883
credit history, tax returns,

784
00:29:23,918 --> 00:29:27,254
and let it season for years
on a shelf.

785
00:29:27,288 --> 00:29:29,557
Someone buys it,
slots their name into it,

786
00:29:29,591 --> 00:29:32,427
and they walk away with
an established corporation

787
00:29:32,461 --> 00:29:34,329
with a preexisting history.

788
00:29:34,363 --> 00:29:35,397
Anyone looks any closer,

789
00:29:35,431 --> 00:29:37,099
they shut it down
and do it again.

790
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:38,534
That's legal?

791
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,069
Shelf companies are legal.

792
00:29:40,103 --> 00:29:42,840
I'm guessing what Tori's
doing with hers isn't.

793
00:29:42,874 --> 00:29:45,176
Wait a minute.
Is it called "Aberdeen"?

794
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,677
Yeah, I saw it on the top
of this list

795
00:29:46,711 --> 00:29:48,713
with 37 other
management companies

796
00:29:48,715 --> 00:29:53,951
all related to Drybeck in
that wrongful termination suit.

797
00:29:53,985 --> 00:29:55,252
When we get back
to the office,

798
00:29:55,286 --> 00:29:56,587
I want you to find
legal precedent

799
00:29:56,621 --> 00:29:58,688
that will allow us
to subpoena the records.

800
00:29:58,723 --> 00:30:00,223
Okay, on it.

801
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:01,724
Do I really have
to pay you back?

802
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:02,926
Every penny.

803
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,560
Wait a minute.

804
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:07,230
How much was in that envelope?

805
00:30:13,602 --> 00:30:15,803
Hey, what are you all doing
at my desk?

806
00:30:15,838 --> 00:30:18,405
Dude, you got to check
this out.

807
00:30:21,242 --> 00:30:25,245
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

Uh-huh.
In the lobby.

on my computer?

Well, we're not gonna risk
watching it on one of ours.

How hard is that to crack?

What did he say to her?

828
00:30:58,644 --> 00:31:00,811
Oh, evidently Louis wants
a restraining order

829
00:31:00,846 --> 00:31:02,213
and he needs this
as evidence.

830
00:31:02,247 --> 00:31:03,614
Oh.

Please don't.

was another trick

Oh, yeah.
I know who you are.

843
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,544
You said if I accepted
the severance agreement,

844
00:31:31,578 --> 00:31:32,845
there wouldn't be a lawsuit.

845

Well, there is one,

We know what Tori
was orchestrating.

we can expose her.

You really want to know?

Uh, I managed
to get a look at some files

What's up with
our accounting firm?

861
00:32:18,621 --> 00:32:20,555
They're stealing from us.

You know your phone bill?

You have all those surcharges,

you have no idea what they mean,
but you pay 'em anyway.

Yeah.

866

Yeah, well, Drybeck's doing
the same thing to us,

867
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:31,395
except all their charges
are a complete scam.

868
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,341
Pretty sure the phone
charges are a scam too.

Yeah, maybe.

870

So what do you need?

00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,938
I need a legal reason
to get those files

without saying
I saw those files.

You need them for court
or you just need them?

Why?

Yeah.

00:36:32,363 --> 00:36:33,830
And before that,
it was Norton Services,

974
00:36:33,865 --> 00:36:35,265
Littleton LLC.

975
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,267
Where did you get those?

976
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:38,002
We know what you did, Tori.

977
00:36:38,036 --> 00:36:39,303
You couldn't have subpoenaed
these files.

978
00:36:39,337 --> 00:36:40,771
And yet we have them.

979
00:36:40,806 --> 00:36:42,006
Take a look.
They're all there.

980
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:44,242
- And now we have proof.
- Proof of what?

981
00:36:44,277 --> 00:36:46,612
Those are all legitimate
corporations used for--

982
00:36:46,646 --> 00:36:48,748
Stealing money
and lining your own pockets.

983
00:36:48,782 --> 00:36:50,650
But don't take my word for it.

984
00:36:50,684 --> 00:36:53,687
Guys?

985
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:59,860
Hello, Tori.

986
00:36:59,895 --> 00:37:02,363
Yeah, we hired Stan to do
a little independent consulting

987
00:37:02,397 --> 00:37:04,264
on our behalf
and he's come

988
00:37:04,299 --> 00:37:06,100
with some very interesting
connections.

989
00:37:06,134 --> 00:37:08,669
It was easy, even if I don't
really have a degree.

990
00:37:08,704 --> 00:37:13,041
There was that vacation
you invited me on last year...

991
00:37:13,075 --> 00:37:15,043
to your new house
in the Bahamas.

992
00:37:15,077 --> 00:37:17,945
A house you bought with money
you stole from this firm.

993
00:37:17,979 --> 00:37:19,981
My firm.

994
00:37:20,015 --> 00:37:20,982
Jessica--

995
00:37:21,016 --> 00:37:22,550
"Jessica" what?

996
00:37:22,584 --> 00:37:24,552
You can't use any of this.

997
00:37:24,586 --> 00:37:26,821
We have attorney-client
privilege.

998
00:37:26,855 --> 00:37:28,222
With Drybeck Accounting,
yes.

999
00:37:28,257 --> 00:37:30,691
With the shelf companies?
No.

1000
00:37:30,726 --> 00:37:31,926
And unfortunately for you,

1001
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,228
you're listed
on the shelf companies.

1002
00:37:34,262 --> 00:37:36,463
You stole from me.

1003
00:37:36,498 --> 00:37:38,666
You either come clean now
or the only time

1004
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,935
you'll see your children
in the next decade

1005
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:43,504
will be during prison
visiting hours.

1006
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,078
So I'm gonna get
my job back now, right?

1007
00:37:50,112 --> 00:37:51,646
I don't see why not.

1008
00:37:51,681 --> 00:37:53,248
No, Stan, you're not.

1009
00:37:53,283 --> 00:37:54,817
What?

1010
00:37:54,851 --> 00:37:57,553
Drybeck's going bankrupt
after this all shakes out.

1011
00:37:57,588 --> 00:37:59,889
Even if they don't,
they're not gonna hire you back.

1012
00:37:59,923 --> 00:38:02,659
Why?

1013
00:38:02,693 --> 00:38:08,566
Because you falsified
your resume.

1014
00:38:08,601 --> 00:38:10,468
What am I supposed
to do now?

1015
00:38:10,502 --> 00:38:12,838
Well, we just got your more
than your severance package.

1016
00:38:12,872 --> 00:38:15,374
I suggest you use it
to tide yourself over

1017
00:38:15,408 --> 00:38:19,578
till you figure something out.

1018
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:32,658
Stan...Hey.

1019
00:38:32,693 --> 00:38:35,294
Your best asset is your mind.

1020
00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:38,130
They can't take that from you.

1021
00:38:38,165 --> 00:38:39,398
One little mistake.

1022
00:38:39,433 --> 00:38:43,468
You could go back to school,
become legitimate.

1023
00:38:43,503 --> 00:38:45,437
Start over?

1024
00:38:50,342 --> 00:38:53,343
I never should have done it.

1025
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,521
[Sighs]

1026
00:39:14,499 --> 00:39:16,633
Told you they wouldn't
catch me.

1027
00:39:16,668 --> 00:39:18,602
What are you looking for,
Harvey?

1028
00:39:18,636 --> 00:39:20,237
- Positive reinforcement?
- Nothing major.

1029
00:39:20,271 --> 00:39:22,271
A trophy,
Nobel.

1030
00:39:22,306 --> 00:39:24,841
Would your likeness in bronze
in the lobby be okay?

1031
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:27,010
Bust or life-size?

1032
00:39:27,044 --> 00:39:29,345
You did a good thing,
Harvey.

1033
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,282
Well, it wasn't just me,
you know?

1034
00:39:32,316 --> 00:39:34,884
Well, then I guess
I should give the kid

1035
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:38,086
the benefit of the doubt
from now on.

1036
00:39:38,121 --> 00:39:41,590
You should.

1037
00:39:54,871 --> 00:39:56,239
Well, you'll be happy
to know

1038
00:39:56,273 --> 00:39:58,007
that Stan has no idea
what he's gonna do

1039
00:39:58,041 --> 00:39:59,175
with the rest of his life.

1040
00:39:59,209 --> 00:40:02,445
That doesn't make me happy.

1041
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,081
Well, what if I tell you
I have no idea

1042
00:40:04,115 --> 00:40:08,186
what I'm doing with mine?

1043
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:12,057
What the hell are we gonna do
when I get caught, Harvey?

1044
00:40:12,091 --> 00:40:13,158
You're not gonna get caught.

1045
00:40:13,192 --> 00:40:17,228
That's your answer?

1046
00:40:17,262 --> 00:40:22,432
What else is there?

1047
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:24,634
Why?

1048
00:40:24,669 --> 00:40:25,769
What?

1049
00:40:25,803 --> 00:40:27,503
Hire me.
Why would you do that to me?

1050
00:40:27,538 --> 00:40:29,738
You mean <i>for</i> you.

1051
00:40:29,773 --> 00:40:30,873
No, I don't.

1052
00:40:30,907 --> 00:40:31,974
You made it perfectly clear

1053
00:40:32,008 --> 00:40:33,141
that you only do things
for yourself.

1054
00:40:33,176 --> 00:40:34,476
So why?

1055
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,545
You mean the reason why
I became a lawyer

1056
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:39,348
or your friend dealt drugs
or you used to cheat?

1057
00:40:39,382 --> 00:40:40,849
I cheated because I needed--

1058
00:40:40,884 --> 00:40:41,983
You couldn't make money
any other way?

1059
00:40:42,018 --> 00:40:44,553
Bullshit.

1060
00:40:44,587 --> 00:40:47,155
Life is this.

1061
00:40:47,189 --> 00:40:49,524
I like this.

1062
00:40:49,558 --> 00:40:51,058
That's not me.

1063
00:40:51,093 --> 00:40:53,428
Well, if it wasn't me,
you wouldn't be here.

1064
00:40:53,462 --> 00:40:54,729
So if you want this to stop,

1065
00:40:54,763 --> 00:40:57,231
all you got to do is tap out.

1066
00:41:10,578 --> 00:41:12,312
- Hello.
- Oh.

1067
00:41:12,346 --> 00:41:13,880
You're here to see Mike.

1068
00:41:13,914 --> 00:41:15,748
We're gonna celebrate
his victory.

1069
00:41:15,783 --> 00:41:19,119
Ah.

1070
00:41:19,154 --> 00:41:21,288
You know, I actually think
that it's a really,

1071
00:41:21,323 --> 00:41:22,890
really good idea that
you've come to pick him up.

1072
00:41:22,924 --> 00:41:24,792
In fact, if I were you,

1073
00:41:24,826 --> 00:41:26,060
I'd do it a little
more often.

1074
00:41:26,095 --> 00:41:29,197
Just all those late nights
working with Rachel.

1075
00:41:29,231 --> 00:41:31,566
What do you mean?

1076
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,368
What do I--
[Laughs]

1077
00:41:33,402 --> 00:41:36,305
Well, come on.
You're a smart girl.

1078
00:41:36,339 --> 00:41:38,540
You understand animal behavior.

1079
00:41:38,574 --> 00:41:40,242
I think you can
figure it out.

1080
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:46,480
Hey.
You ready?

1081
00:41:46,514 --> 00:41:48,649
Yeah.

1082
