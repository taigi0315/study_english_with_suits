showing you our private books

- Am I laughing?

Look, I may not have been
awake during our M&A Clinic--

Except for when you
were copying my notes.

Which was no walk in the park.
You write like a monkey.

Then we
don't have a deal.

it's because you killed it.

I don't see you rushing
to show us <i>your</i> private books.

to our books right now.

Hey, are you okay?
Now you care?

Mr. Ross,
I'm gonna have to ask you

336
00:13:31,132 --> 00:13:33,032
not to speak to my client.
She's not your client.

337
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,567
She is Rachel
the paralegal.

338

And I only have
five minutes,

339
00:13:36,002 --> 00:13:37,636
so you should really
get out of my face.

340
00:13:37,704 --> 00:13:39,138
- What's your problem, Mike?
- My problem is that you

341
00:13:39,206 --> 00:13:41,173
don't have the balls
to make this a fair fight, Kyle.

342
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:42,908
Lawyering
isn't about fighting fair,

343
00:13:42,976 --> 00:13:44,543
and you'd better watch
your false accusations,

344
00:13:44,611 --> 00:13:47,513
or I might just sue you
for defamation.

345
00:13:47,581 --> 00:13:49,415

Defamation of character.

The plaintiff's video
negatively impacted

the perception
of Lena Lunders

353
00:14:03,664 --> 00:14:05,031
and impaired
her financial well-being.

That's ridiculous,
Your Honor.

355

In order for there
to be defamation,

356
00:14:08,268 --> 00:14:09,936
the statements made
would've had to have been false.

357
00:14:10,004 --> 00:14:11,504
That's not the case here.
Then you should have

358
00:14:11,572 --> 00:14:13,173
no problem proving that
in court.

359

The countersuit
is allowed.

- Are you serious?
- Would you like

361
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:22,415
to approach the bench
and find out how serious I am?

362
00:14:24,752 --> 00:14:26,553
Your Honor, the defense
should've filed counterclaims

363
00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:28,622
before the trial began.
Yes, he should have.

But no one
in this crop of associates

had the foresight
to do so.

And we drafted
a whole addendum

367

just because we assumed
one of you would.

So I'm going
to allow it.

Do you have
a problem with that?

Why didn't you tell me
Scottie was opposing counsel?

Because I didn't want you

was show her our books.

another person.

Take the drama
down a notch, Juliet.

I tried to settle,
and I got completely blindsided.

395

I told you to settle.
I didn't tell you to be stupid.

What do you think's gonna
happen in the real world?

397

You have to be prepared
for anything.

Well,
in the real world,

399
00:15:49,137 --> 00:15:50,638
I won't have to
be looking for someone

400

to play my fake witness
in my fake trial.

Wait, wait, wait.
What do you think?

402
00:15:54,077 --> 00:15:55,745
Do you think witnesses
are just gonna jump up

403
00:15:55,812 --> 00:15:57,647
and present themselves?
'Cause they're not.

404
00:15:57,714 --> 00:15:59,615
And sometimes
when you have one,

405

they disappear
or recant.

And you know what you do?
You deal with it.

407
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,087
Mock trial
is about figuring out

408

what type of lawyer
you wanna be,

409

winners and losers.

That sounds great, Harvey,
but I haven't prepared.

I don't have anyone to play
my client or my witness,

412
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:16,132

I'm going up against someone

00:26:14,231 --> 00:26:15,998
I believe
we have a wager.

631
00:26:16,066 --> 00:26:18,134
Well, you know what?
Some of us shower

632
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,069
before we go to work.
[Clears throat]

633
00:26:20,137 --> 00:26:21,271
Mr. Specter--
- You know what? Save it.

634
00:26:21,338 --> 00:26:23,273
Right.

635
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:26,544
How you feeling?

636
00:26:26,611 --> 00:26:28,346
- Good.
- Good?

637
00:26:28,413 --> 00:26:29,647
- Yeah.
- Good.

638
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:32,083
Is it inappropriate
to take a Xanax

639
00:26:32,151 --> 00:26:34,553
if you're a witness
in a trial?

640
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,487
I've seen clients
do much worse.

641
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:38,289
[Chuckles]

642
00:26:38,357 --> 00:26:41,359
Actually, I'm not a client.
I'm a witness

643
00:26:41,426 --> 00:26:43,260
in a friend's mock trial.

644
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,595
One thing--
if you get into trouble,

645
00:26:44,662 --> 00:26:47,297
don't play the case.
Play the man.

646
00:26:47,365 --> 00:26:48,765
What are you
talking about?

647
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:50,634
Good lawyers
worry about facts.

648
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:54,103
Great lawyers worry
about their opponents.

649
00:26:54,171 --> 00:26:56,606
Kyle is cocky
and devious.

650
00:26:56,673 --> 00:26:58,842
Figure out a way
to use that against him.

651
00:27:00,111 --> 00:27:02,145
Okay.
Anything else?

652
00:27:02,213 --> 00:27:04,281
Kick his ass.

653
00:27:04,349 --> 00:27:07,685
- Who's your friend?
- Oh, uh, Mike Ross.

654
00:27:07,753 --> 00:27:10,155
Do you know him?

655
00:27:10,222 --> 00:27:11,723
Uh, yeah.
Uh, it's a big firm,

656
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:13,525
but I know who he is.

657
00:27:13,593 --> 00:27:15,461
Yeah.

658
00:27:15,528 --> 00:27:18,430
God, I don't know
why I'm so nervous.

659
00:27:18,498 --> 00:27:20,465
I just know this
is a big deal to him,

660
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:22,167
and I don't wanna
let him down.

661
00:27:22,235 --> 00:27:23,968
Hmm.

662
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:29,406
Sydney Thompson was at a party
and made a joke.

663
00:27:29,474 --> 00:27:30,740
It wasn't meant
to be mean

664
00:27:30,808 --> 00:27:32,843
or to be taken
as fact,

665
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,812
and it most certainly
was never meant to be public.

666
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,849
The defense will show--
that Sydney Thompson chose

667
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:41,385
to publicly defame her boss
with an impression

668
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,220
that she knew
would be damaging,

669
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:46,224
both to Lena Lunders' reputation
and her company.

670
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:49,327
I call Lena Lunders
to the stand.

671
00:27:49,395 --> 00:27:53,198
[Sobbing]

672
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:00,439
Uh...Do you need
a minute?

673
00:28:00,507 --> 00:28:03,408
No.
[Sniffles]

674
00:28:03,476 --> 00:28:05,644
I can continue.
Thank you.

675
00:28:07,781 --> 00:28:10,716
Please.

676
00:28:10,784 --> 00:28:14,019
I'm a self-made woman.

677
00:28:14,087 --> 00:28:16,021
I created
the global initiative

678
00:28:16,089 --> 00:28:18,590
to target problems
in third-world countries.

679
00:28:18,658 --> 00:28:21,860
I take my work
very seriously,

680
00:28:21,927 --> 00:28:25,297
and if a joke
can be made of that,

681
00:28:25,365 --> 00:28:28,400
fine.

682
00:28:28,467 --> 00:28:31,603
But as a woman in power,
people look at your success

683
00:28:31,671 --> 00:28:33,538
and label you.

684
00:28:33,605 --> 00:28:35,740
They don't know
the complexity it takes

685
00:28:35,808 --> 00:28:37,809
for a woman to succeed
in this business.

686
00:28:37,876 --> 00:28:41,145
And when someone
undermines that,

687
00:28:41,213 --> 00:28:43,948
well...

688
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:47,719
We have to fight
for ourselves...

689
00:28:47,787 --> 00:28:50,488
Don't we,
Your Honor?

690
00:28:50,556 --> 00:28:51,956
Objection.

691
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:54,926
So it's hard to be
a woman in business?

692
00:28:54,994 --> 00:28:57,495
That has nothing to do
with the facts of this case.

693
00:28:57,563 --> 00:28:59,931
Well, we can only understand
the damage your client has done

694
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:02,267
by fully understanding
the care with which Miss Lunders

695
00:29:02,335 --> 00:29:04,603
has built her reputation.

696
00:29:06,773 --> 00:29:08,773
Um, I'm sorry.

697
00:29:08,841 --> 00:29:12,144
Can you ask me the question
one more time?

698
00:29:13,413 --> 00:29:15,247
Take a deep breath.

699
00:29:15,315 --> 00:29:16,715
[Sighs]

700
00:29:16,783 --> 00:29:19,051
It's just you and me.

701
00:29:19,118 --> 00:29:21,086
We're just gonna have
a conversation about your job,

702
00:29:21,154 --> 00:29:24,056
okay?
Yeah, okay.

703
00:29:24,123 --> 00:29:26,458
How do you know
the defendant Sydney Thompson?

704
00:29:26,525 --> 00:29:29,561
We were coworkers.
We started at the same level,

705
00:29:29,629 --> 00:29:31,964
and then I was promoted
to be her immediate superior.

706
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,833
And do you know
about the video in question?

707
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:35,534
Yes. I was at
the party that night.

708
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:37,603
And what were you
celebrating that night?

709
00:29:37,671 --> 00:29:39,338
My promotion.

710
00:29:39,406 --> 00:29:42,341
Same night.
That's interesting.

711
00:29:42,409 --> 00:29:44,543
Miss Ginnesse.

712
00:29:44,611 --> 00:29:46,112
What did you think
of the impersonation?

713
00:29:46,179 --> 00:29:49,815
It was too far.
It was mean.

714
00:29:49,883 --> 00:29:52,517
So why do you think
Miss Thompson did it?

715
00:29:52,585 --> 00:29:55,053
Miss Lunders promoted me.
Sydney hated it.

716
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:57,155
And that's why
she made the video.

717
00:29:58,592 --> 00:30:00,426
Well, thank you,
Miss Ginnesse.

718
00:30:00,494 --> 00:30:02,395
Nothing further,
Your Honor.

719
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:05,699
Did Sydney ever tell you

720
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:07,568
that she hated
your promotion?

721
00:30:07,636 --> 00:30:10,471
- Not exactly.
- Yes or no, please.

722
00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:12,406
- No.
- Well, then how do you know

723
00:30:12,474 --> 00:30:14,608
that she hated
your promotion?

724
00:30:14,676 --> 00:30:16,544
I could just tell.

725
00:30:16,611 --> 00:30:18,078
Can you tell what
I'm thinking right now?

726
00:30:18,146 --> 00:30:19,780
That you're wishing
I would agree

727
00:30:19,848 --> 00:30:22,549
with everything you say?
No. I was thinking

728
00:30:22,617 --> 00:30:24,051
that if you could
actually read my mind,

729
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:25,519
I wouldn't bother
asking you the questions.

730
00:30:25,587 --> 00:30:26,887
But you can't read my mind,
can you?

731
00:30:26,955 --> 00:30:28,889
No, I'm--I'm
managing director--

732
00:30:28,957 --> 00:30:31,524
No. And I'm pretty sure
you can't read Sydney's either.

733
00:30:31,592 --> 00:30:34,861
And you actually have no idea
<i>why</i> she made that video.

734
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:37,731
Correct?

735
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:41,034
I guess I don't. No.

736
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,609
Good afternoon,
Miss Scott.

737
00:30:47,677 --> 00:30:50,446
Thank you.

738
00:30:50,514 --> 00:30:52,048
[Sighs]

739
00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:54,283
Are you here to give me
a proper send-off?

740
00:30:54,351 --> 00:30:56,585
I don't think we can do that
out here on the street.

741
00:30:56,653 --> 00:30:58,420
- You sure?
- You tricked me.

742
00:30:58,488 --> 00:30:59,988
I'm impressed.

743
00:31:00,056 --> 00:31:02,925
To be fair,
Vega did want a merger.

744
00:31:02,993 --> 00:31:04,760
I just convinced him that,

745
00:31:04,828 --> 00:31:06,762
given your client's propensity
for rash purchases,

746
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,465
that allowing him to
stay in charge was a bad idea.

747
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:11,567
Vega needed Debeque's hotels
minus Debeque,

748
00:31:11,635 --> 00:31:13,302
and I found a way.

749
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,304
One that he never
asked for or wanted,

750
00:31:15,372 --> 00:31:18,107
and one that
he's never gonna get.

751
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:22,645
[Laughs]
Was--is this for real?

752
00:31:22,713 --> 00:31:24,413
Three of Debeque's properties.
It'll be on the market

753
00:31:24,481 --> 00:31:25,915
by the end of day.
He's never gonna let you

754
00:31:25,983 --> 00:31:27,583
sell off
his crown jewels.

755
00:31:27,651 --> 00:31:29,385
See, that's the thing
about passionate clients.

756
00:31:29,453 --> 00:31:31,053
When they're crossed,
they get angry,

757
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:32,688
and they'll do anything
to get back.

758
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:36,960
Don't do this, Harvey.

759
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,062
Look, there's another way
we can do this.

760
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:41,598
We can get our clients
into a room together,

761
00:31:41,665 --> 00:31:43,532
you can tell them
you were wrong,

762
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,336
and we can convince them
back into a merger.

763
00:31:48,338 --> 00:31:50,940
Miss Thompson,
what was the intent

764
00:31:51,008 --> 00:31:52,508
behind
your impersonation?

765
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,976
I was just trying
to be funny.

766
00:31:54,044 --> 00:31:55,678
Everyone in our office
makes jokes,

767
00:31:55,745 --> 00:31:57,246
and as a matter of fact,

768
00:31:57,314 --> 00:31:59,248
Ms. Lunders encourages us
to be informal.

769
00:31:59,316 --> 00:32:01,684
I can't win this
just on facts.

770
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:03,518
- ...Passed over for promotion.
- But I expected it.

771
00:32:03,586 --> 00:32:07,189
I think everyone
has the impulse to move up,

772
00:32:07,256 --> 00:32:08,857
but at a certain point,
you just have to let it go.

773
00:32:08,925 --> 00:32:10,425
So that's what I did.

774
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:11,927
What are you gonna do?

775
00:32:11,994 --> 00:32:13,562
I've never held
ill will for my boss.

776
00:32:13,629 --> 00:32:17,733
I'm gonna play the woman,
not the case.

777
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,401
You say you expected
to be passed over

778
00:32:19,469 --> 00:32:21,103
for a promotion, correct?
Yes.

779
00:32:21,171 --> 00:32:23,405
And yet you applied
three times?

780
00:32:23,473 --> 00:32:25,540
- Yes.
- And you were never promoted?

781
00:32:25,608 --> 00:32:27,709
As I said, yes.

782
00:32:27,777 --> 00:32:29,444
And when Nora Ginnesse
was promoted,

783
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:31,547
you wrote scathing emails
to the rest

784
00:32:31,615 --> 00:32:33,449
of your coworkers in response.
No, not scathing.

785
00:32:33,517 --> 00:32:35,151
The intent
was to be funny.

786
00:32:35,218 --> 00:32:36,552
Oh, right,
you like to be funny.

787
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:37,920
Who doesn't like
