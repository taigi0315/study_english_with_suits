1
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,628
Everyone is wearing a black tie.

2
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:09,320
You're wearing a gray tie.

3
00:00:09,403 --> 00:00:11,239
This is acceptable
at a black tie affair.

4
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,997
There's nothing wrong
with the tie that I'm wearing.

5
00:00:15,747 --> 00:00:17,192
Champagne, sir?

6
00:00:17,275 --> 00:00:19,735
Is it?
From the region?

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,663
In France?

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,921
Because if it's not,
it's called sparkling wine,

9
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:26,461
And I don't really drink sparkling wine.
Forget it.

10
00:00:26,544 --> 00:00:29,031
Forgive him.
His parents really wanted a girl.

11
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:30,186
Never got over it.

12
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,531
{\*Wait a minute.}You can taste the difference.
I'm not being a snob.

13
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,492
Not a snob?
You sound like Frasier's brother.

14
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,509
Niles crane
was completely misunderstood.

15
00:00:36,592 --> 00:00:38,704
{\*Okay,}Boys, you don't want me
to give you a time-out now?

16
00:00:38,976 --> 00:00:41,874
I'd be willing to stand in a corner
if you agree to paddle his bottom.

17
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:43,358
That's hilarious.

18
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:44,915
{\*I'm just saying that}If they want us to donate

19
00:00:44,998 --> 00:00:47,018
to their charity,
they might as well step it up.

20
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:49,539
- {\*You know,}Make me want to give away my money.
- Your money?

21
00:00:49,622 --> 00:00:51,384
You're here representing
the firm, Louis.

22
00:00:51,747 --> 00:00:54,190
And we've always been committed
to giving back to the community.

23
00:00:54,536 --> 00:00:56,722
Jessica, is that...

24
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:00,593
Tori.
Yes, and I owe her a call.

25
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:02,303
Excuse me.

26
00:01:08,143 --> 00:01:09,599
Do I smell like sausage?

27
00:01:10,168 --> 00:01:11,507
No more than usual.
Why?

28
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,982
Because I'm about to meet
the future Mrs. Louis Litt.

29
00:01:14,065 --> 00:01:15,177
I had pizza before I came,

30
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,581
I just want to make sure
I still am not emanating any aroma.

31
00:01:17,664 --> 00:01:19,247
You're emanating something.

32
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:22,498
It's called pheromones
and women find it irresistible.

33
00:01:25,122 --> 00:01:26,308
Watch this.

34
00:01:32,805 --> 00:01:34,308
You remember Tori?

35
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:36,137
Of course.
Nice to see you.

36
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:39,260
I told Jessica I don't really want
to talk shop while we're here

37
00:01:39,343 --> 00:01:40,641
to support a good cause.

38
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:42,701
That's the beautiful thing
about a retainer.

39
00:01:42,784 --> 00:01:44,415
We're always on call
when you need us.

40
00:01:44,498 --> 00:01:46,071
So how can we help?

41
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:49,608
It involves one of our most
trusted senior VPs.

42
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:52,014
Something recently came to light
about his past

43
00:01:52,097 --> 00:01:53,571
And I'm shocked by it, really.

44
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,532
You tell us where it hurts
and we'll make it go away.

45
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:10,259
Wait.

46
00:02:11,212 --> 00:02:12,429
Wait?

47
00:02:12,746 --> 00:02:13,746
It's just...

48
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:16,052
This feels like
it's moving really fast.

49
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,803
I should slow down?

50
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,737
No, I just got out
of a relationship and...

51
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:22,922
Right.

52
00:02:23,005 --> 00:02:24,445
You kind of did too.

53
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,353
I wasn't really seeing anyone.

54
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,688
You know what I mean.

55
00:02:29,474 --> 00:02:30,566
Trevor.

56
00:02:31,797 --> 00:02:34,035
- Yeah, Trevor.
- Right. Trevor.

57
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,686
You're right.
We should slow down.

58
00:02:40,842 --> 00:02:42,928
I should make us some tea.
You want some tea?

59
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:46,112
- Let's drink some tea.
- Thank you.

60
00:02:51,707 --> 00:02:54,126
What's the harvard club?

61
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:58,434
It's, like, this clubhouse
for harvard alumni.

62
00:02:58,868 --> 00:03:02,861
That invite, it's for
this networking thing for lawyers.

63
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:04,201
I got it at work.

64
00:03:04,589 --> 00:03:05,846
Would you go?

65
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:07,481
What?
Are you kidding me?

66
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:08,892
No.

67
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:10,810
I have a hard enough time
pretending at work.

68
00:03:10,893 --> 00:03:13,042
It's not like
I want to enter the lion's den.

69
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:19,989
If you were gonna go...

70
00:03:21,512 --> 00:03:24,709
- And you were gonna take a date...
- It would be you.

71
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,082
I'd love to take you.

72
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,766
Who's moving too fast now?

73
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,765
That's due to saying
all the right things.

74
00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:50,479
Hey, what's the emergency?

75
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,649
- Couldn't find a date to the prom?
- We're firing Stan Jacobson.

76
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:55,178
Who?

77
00:03:55,261 --> 00:03:57,611
Senior Vice President,
Drybeck Accounting.

78
00:03:58,021 --> 00:03:59,280
Our accounting firm?

79
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:02,449
- They're our firm and our client.
- How's that possible?

80
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,213
They signed a conflict
of interest waiver.

81
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:07,536
Look at that. He's actually learning
how the law works.

82
00:04:08,134 --> 00:04:10,152
Acquaint yourself
with Drybeck's company charter

83
00:04:10,235 --> 00:04:12,050
and Stan's original
employment contract.

84
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:14,087
- What'd he do?
- He lied.

85
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,046
He lied?
About what?

86
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,156
Wait, let me guess.
He cooked the books.

87
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,067
God, doesn't anyone on wall street
Put in an honest day's work anymore?

88
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,471
Actually, he's got
a stellar record as a senior VP.

89
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,181
He lied on his resume.

90
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:28,167
Never got his CPA license.

91
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,956
Never even went to business school.

92
00:04:30,891 --> 00:04:34,023
He lied about where he went to school
and now he's getting fired?

93
00:04:34,346 --> 00:04:36,650
Drybeck does the books
for half of wall street.

94
00:04:37,616 --> 00:04:39,772
Word gets out that
a senior staff is a fraud,

95
00:04:39,855 --> 00:04:41,796
they're gonna start
bleeding clients.

96
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,292
We have to do this fast
and keep it quiet.

97
00:04:46,343 --> 00:04:47,494
Relax.

98
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:49,351
That's not gonna happen to you.

99
00:04:49,717 --> 00:04:51,928
But I would get fired
if Jessica found out.

100
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:53,334
Found out what?

101
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:56,586
Just told me he's a virgin.

102
00:04:57,217 --> 00:04:58,714
That doesn't surprise me one bit.

103
00:04:59,063 --> 00:05:00,559
All in due time, Mike.

104
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:03,260
You have those severance quotes?

105
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,434
La Royal Team présente:

106
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:12,811
Suits - 1 x 10 - The Shelf Life

107
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,460
JJBrqmz

108
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:58,006
Where you headed, doll?

109
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:00,454
Pearson Hardman to see Mike Ross.

110
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,695
He expecting you?

111
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,535
No, I just was gonna drop this off.

112
00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:06,511
No appointment. I can't let you up.

113
00:06:07,282 --> 00:06:08,659
Do I look like a terrorist?

114
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,744
Do I look like I want
to lose my job?

115
00:06:13,658 --> 00:06:14,766
You here to see Mike?

116
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:17,126
Sort of. I was gonna
drop this suit off for him.

117
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:19,878
Harvey called late last night,
some big emergency,

118
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,611
And Mike ended up staying the night.

119
00:06:21,694 --> 00:06:24,900
Actually, could you help me out
I'm running so late to work.

120
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:26,760
- Sure.
- Oh, my god. Thank you.

121
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,638
Thanks.

122
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:34,268
Can you tell Mike
that I left the key under the mat?

123
00:06:34,865 --> 00:06:35,853
Absolutely.

124
00:06:36,494 --> 00:06:38,272
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

125
00:07:00,434 --> 00:07:02,921
- I'm up.
- Your girlfriend stopped by.

126
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,008
- Dropped that off for you.
- Girlfriend?

127
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:09,147
- You guys move in together already?
- What? No.

128
00:07:09,475 --> 00:07:11,221
She's not my... why do you care?

129
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,391
I don't. What was
the big emergency last night?

130
00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:18,145
Harvey. He's firing some big VP
from our accounting firm this morning.

131
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:19,730
Stan Jacobson?

132
00:07:20,264 --> 00:07:22,024
Yeah, why? You know him?

133
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,426
No, he was just checking in
at reception when I got there.

134
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:26,934
Oh, god! I got to change.

135
00:07:27,724 --> 00:07:29,719
I will let him know
that you will be right there.

136
00:07:29,802 --> 00:07:30,616
Thanks.

137
00:07:42,315 --> 00:07:44,609
Performance numbers, HR guidelines,
severance quotes.

138
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:47,091
- Stan's in the waiting room.
- Did you sleep here last night?

139
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,094
- I wouldn't exactly call it sleeping.
- Where'd you get that suit?

140
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,345
Rachel.

141
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:54,223
No, I mean Jenny gave it
to Rachel downstairs.

142
00:07:54,572 --> 00:07:57,629
She slept over last night.
Jenny did, not Rachel.

143
00:07:57,712 --> 00:07:59,859
Do I really need to be here
when you fire this guy?

144
00:07:59,942 --> 00:08:01,658
You want to learn
how it's done, right?

145
00:08:01,884 --> 00:08:03,681
I read this guy's
employment records.

146
00:08:03,764 --> 00:08:05,609
He's smart, talented, loyal.

147
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,498
And you feel bad for him.
I'm shocked.

148
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,368
Where's my smoking gun?

149
00:08:10,253 --> 00:08:12,616
Background check that confirmed
Stan lied about his credentials.

150
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,176
It never came through.

151
00:08:15,323 --> 00:08:16,323
On it.

152
00:08:20,127 --> 00:08:21,285
Come in, come in.

153
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,919
Could you help me with something?
I need to get this fax for Harvey...

154
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,087
Good morning.

155
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:28,424
Good morning.
You can tell, can't you?

156
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:30,592
I bet you everybody can.

157
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,247
Tell what?

158
00:08:35,127 --> 00:08:36,807
You... Wax your eyebrows?

159
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,309
I was with the most
beautiful woman last night.

160
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:42,479
She wax your eyebrows?

161
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:46,242
We did a lot of things last night
and waxing wasn't one of them,

162
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,277
if you know what I mean.

163
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:49,570
Oh, god.

164
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,209
That's great.{\*I'm here to ask...}

165
00:08:51,292 --> 00:08:53,240
Her name's Charisse,
we have so much in common.

166
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:55,547
And Mike, there was like this...

167
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,940
There was like this, "mmm."

168
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,662
Like a "mmm."

169
00:08:59,215 --> 00:09:01,605
Like a chemical thing would happen
when our bodies would touch.

170
00:09:01,805 --> 00:09:03,920
I really don't want to have
this conversation with you.

171
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:05,000
{\Come on.}We're both guys.

172
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,860
Little locker room talk
around the office.

173
00:09:06,943 --> 00:09:09,640
- That creates a little male bonding.
- That's crazy. I just heard my name.

174
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:11,442
Did you hear that?
Someone's calling me.

175
00:09:12,117 --> 00:09:13,168
{\*I'm gonna...}Just one second.{\*okay ?}

176
00:09:14,893 --> 00:09:16,262
He's probably still a virgin.

177
00:09:17,592 --> 00:09:19,108
Hi. Mike Ross, Harvey's associate.

178
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,640
So sorry to keep you waiting.
Just gonna be a couple more minutes.

179
00:09:21,723 --> 00:09:23,270
Okay, great. Thank you.

180
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,024
Yes, I hear you.
Your office couldn't find a copy.

181
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,382
Can you tell me the name

182
00:09:28,465 --> 00:09:31,737
of the security firm you guys
used to do the background check?

183
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:33,025
Okay, great.

184
00:09:33,108 --> 00:09:34,156
Nope. That's great.

185
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,408
I found the number myself.
Thank you.

186
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,560
Sally, yes.

187
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,389
This is Mike Ross
for Pearson Hardman.

188
00:09:39,472 --> 00:09:41,938
I'm calling regarding
a background check you guys did.

189
00:09:42,408 --> 00:09:43,332
Sure.

190
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,960
You could refuse to cooperate,
but then you would be wrong.

191
00:09:47,948 --> 00:09:49,499
Sally, hold on one minute.

192
00:09:49,886 --> 00:09:50,672
Yeah?

193
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,073
No, Stan is going to be there
in two minutes.

194
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:55,351
He's in the bathroom.

195
00:09:58,759 --> 00:09:59,973
Sally, you there?

196
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,202
Let's do this.

197
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:04,900
I'm gonna fax you the subpoena
that I'm holding in my hand right now

198
00:10:04,983 --> 00:10:07,363
and you can show that
to your boss and then we...

199
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,358
Great.

200
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,014
Let me send you my fax number now.

201
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:15,498
Nice.

202
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:27,960
- Stan.
- We ready?

203
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,573
Yes.
I'm sorry about that.

204
00:10:29,656 --> 00:10:31,013
No worries.

205
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:32,422
I know you, by the way.

206
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,327
7611053.

207
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,741
Your employee code.
See, I remember everyone that way.

208
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:42,891
Anyway, you are taking me to see Harvey.
I have been dying to meet him.

209
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:46,093
- Why is that?
- His balls.

210
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:49,306
His autographed ones.
I'm a huge baseball fan.

211
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:50,733
Oh, right.
Really?

212
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,222
If I wasn't an accountant,
I would be a major league scout.

213
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:57,307
I can tell you anything you want to know
just by looking at somebody's numbers.

214
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,618
For instance, slugging percentage versus
strikeouts during spring training...

215
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,478
Do you want to walk and talk maybe?

216
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,672
Stan Jacobson.

217
00:11:08,755 --> 00:11:10,877
Mr. Specter, it is a pleasure.

218
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,014
It's nice to meet you.
Has Mike...

219
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:16,224
{\*Oh, my god!}Is that them?

220
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,553
Jeter.

221
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,500
Hank Aaron.

222
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,006
No way!
Maris?

223
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:25,559
That's not number 61, is it?

224
00:11:25,847 --> 00:11:28,629
- No, but it was signed by Tracy...
- Stallard.

225
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,761
Big baseball fan.

226
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,775
Stan, why don't you have
a seat over here?

227
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,527
Why don't I get us some waters?

228
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,563
Sorry.

229
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:40,013
I get talking about baseball,
I cannot stop.

230
00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:44,881
I know how valuable your time is.
I do do the books.

231
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:46,353
And speaking of which,

232
00:11:46,436 --> 00:11:49,803
your assistant tells me you wanted to go
over something from your last audits.

233
00:11:49,886 --> 00:11:51,345
I could really use a water.

234
00:11:53,402 --> 00:11:55,589
Stan, we're not here to go
over any accounting business.

235
00:11:56,293 --> 00:11:58,008
You're here because
you're being let go.

236
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,155
What?

237
00:12:01,238 --> 00:12:03,746
It's not gonna feel that surprising
when you understand why.

238
00:12:04,035 --> 00:12:05,886
The firm looked into your
background recently.

239
00:12:05,969 --> 00:12:08,237
They know you lied
about passing the CPA exam.

240
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:11,564
You were hired because
of your outstanding credentials

241
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,774
and the reality
is they never existed.

242
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,499
I've been there for nine years.

243
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:22,754
My work has been nothing but...

244
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,299
Why would this even matter now?

245
00:12:25,382 --> 00:12:27,371
You have been committing fraud
your entire career.

246
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:30,127
- The liability it presents.
- No! I don't accept this.

247
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,287
Take a deep breath.

248
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,137
Once you go
over the severance numbers,

249
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,253
you'll see that we've been
more than fair.

250
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:37,782
Fair?

251
00:12:39,145 --> 00:12:40,552
You think this is fair?

252
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:43,521
We understand
how difficult this must be, Stan.

253
00:12:43,604 --> 00:12:44,971
How you must feel right now.

254
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,241
You have no idea
what I feel right now.

255
00:12:49,545 --> 00:12:53,480
Just so I'm clear... You're not denying
what we're presenting you with?

256
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:57,836
You mean that I lied
back when Drybeck hired me?

257
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:02,729
No.

258
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:06,221
But I'm not some scam artist either.
I did go to college.

259
00:13:06,304 --> 00:13:10,201
I just couldn't afford to graduate.
No one ever questioned it before

260
00:13:10,284 --> 00:13:12,175
because I'm that good with numbers.

261
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,606
Then they find out all of a sudden.

262
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,133
They didn't.

263
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,105
This background check
is five years old.

264
00:13:25,944 --> 00:13:26,944
What?

265
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:28,666
That doesn't make sense.

266
00:13:29,202 --> 00:13:30,934
- Is this the original?
- Yeah.

267
00:13:32,005 --> 00:13:34,938
So Tori knew...
All this time?

268
00:13:37,498 --> 00:13:39,731
This is the same thing
that happened to Paula.

269
00:13:39,814 --> 00:13:41,450
- Who?
- Paula.

270
00:13:41,642 --> 00:13:43,155
Discovered some undisclosed income,

271
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,311
the books weren't adding up,
she brought it to me.

272
00:13:45,394 --> 00:13:46,908
The next thing I know, she is gone.

273
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,619
I asked Tori about it, then I start
getting shut out of meetings.

274
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,289
They're trying to hide something
and they're firing me so they can.

275
00:13:53,147 --> 00:13:55,280
- Where are you going?
- I'm not signing some agreement.

276
00:13:55,363 --> 00:13:58,039
Are you kidding me?
I'm getting railroaded!

277
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,797
- Should I go after him?
- No.

278
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,008
You've done enough already.

279
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:06,648
{\pub}

280
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:09,096
So you let him leave?

281
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,534
Physically restraining someone
is not in my job description.

282
00:14:13,172 --> 00:14:16,371
Well, what about your associate,
the one who shared the background check?

283
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,038
That was a confidential
internal document.

284
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:21,800
Stan should have never seen it.
Why did you even have it?

285
00:14:21,883 --> 00:14:24,196
You didn't expect us to fire him
without proof, did you?

286
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,649
Tori's right.
Stan shouldn't have seen it.

287
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,408
Then I'm guilty of being thorough.

288
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,203
I still don't understand why you haven't
told us the whole truth.

289
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,646
If you knew five years ago,

290
00:14:32,729 --> 00:14:34,664
why'd you make it sound like
this is something recent?

291
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,666
Because it only came
to my attention two days ago.

292
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,178
Then who ordered
the background check?

293
00:14:38,261 --> 00:14:40,504
It's routine.
You check with human resources.

294
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,330
Is it routine for human resources

295
00:14:42,413 --> 00:14:45,139
to keep something
from the CEO for half a decade?

296
00:14:45,222 --> 00:14:46,922
What are you insinuating?

297
00:14:48,195 --> 00:14:52,798
I think what Harvey is saying is given
how quickly we tried to accomplish this,

298
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:55,029
Some of the details
might have gotten lost.

299
00:14:55,112 --> 00:14:58,034
What was also lost is that Stan
never signed the severance package,

300
00:14:58,117 --> 00:14:59,984
which inuded
the confidentiality agreement,

301
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,809
which means
if he decides to make waves,

302
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:03,872
the whole point of avoiding
negative publicity...

303
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:05,687
Harvey will track down Stan

304
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,423
and make sure that he signs
the severance package

305
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:11,018
and the confidentiality
agreement today.

306
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,264
You have my word.

307
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:17,610
- Thank you.
- Of course.

308
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:24,762
It's allight, Tori.

309
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:30,470
She's lying.
She knew about Stan.

310
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,348
- She's known for a long time.
- And that matters to us why?

311
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,685
Because she's taking advantage of us.
We are being manipulated into firing

312
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,229
one of her employees
and told not to ask questions.

313
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:40,647
I have questions.

314
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,252
And the answer is ten.

315
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,194
As in $10 million per year...

316
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,698
The amount of business Drybeck
generates for this firm.

317
00:15:50,024 --> 00:15:52,668
Which means you have to finish
what you started.

318
00:15:53,044 --> 00:15:55,618
Find Stan and get him
to sign those documents.

319
00:15:56,418 --> 00:15:57,741
And as far as I'm concerned,

320
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:00,046
that little associate
of yours iso blame for all of this.

321
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:01,459
That was an honest mistake.

322
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,963
He knowingly revealed
the client's confidential document.

323
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:07,048
That is not a mistake.

324
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,621
How many more chances
are you gonna give that kid?

325
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,075
I didn't realize
we were keeping score.

326
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:16,085
But if that's the case, I still think
he's coming out ahead.

327
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,613
- Whatever you're doing, stop.
- You're gonna want to see this.

328
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,621
Paula O'Neil, the former Drybeck
employee that Stan mentioned,

329
00:16:32,704 --> 00:16:36,077
she filed a wrongful termination suit
that mysteriously went away.

330
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,204
Really?
Let me see that.

331
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:42,208
Come with me.

332
00:16:44,776 --> 00:16:46,568
Do you not think something
funny's going on?

333
00:16:46,651 --> 00:16:48,173
{\*You know what?}Here's what I think is going on.

334
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,508
You're sympathizing with Stan
because you think he's you.

335
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,613
That doesn't mean that...

336
00:16:51,696 --> 00:16:53,562
You need to learn something
from what just happened,

337
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:57,023
not the least of which is how anyone,
no matter how valuable, can be let go.

338
00:16:57,274 --> 00:16:59,100
I can chalk up
what happened with Stan

339
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,770
to youthful exuberance,
but Jessica can't.

340
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,837
So if you want to work here, you better
go home now, because if she sees you...

341
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,094
{\*Wait}Is she gonna fire me?

342
00:17:06,177 --> 00:17:09,778
This habit of you empathizing with every
client, it's not getting you anywhere.

343
00:17:10,427 --> 00:17:11,800
You want to work in this firm?

344
00:17:11,883 --> 00:17:15,742
You need to deal in facts, evidence,
information that can hold up.

345
00:17:16,338 --> 00:17:18,738
That's what a real lawyer does.

346
00:17:35,975 --> 00:17:37,055
Stan.

347
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:40,805
Did you follow me here?

348
00:17:40,888 --> 00:17:43,097
Doesn't take a sleuth to figure out
that your next step

349
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,044
would be to see another lawyer.

350
00:17:45,468 --> 00:17:47,261
Bopal and williams.

351
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,087
They're a good firm.
Not the friendliest bunch.

352
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,355
They called you.
That is against lawyer-client privilege.

353
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,738
No one's breaking any laws.

354
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,393
My assistant has a network
of other assistants

355
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,194
That tell her anything
she wants to know.

356
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,442
Like when someone calls
for an emergency appointment.

357
00:18:00,773 --> 00:18:02,236
You forgot this when you left.

358
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,542
- I said I'm not signing anything.
- It's nothing to sign.

359
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:06,960
It's a lawsuit.

360
00:18:07,447 --> 00:18:09,590
You worked for Drybeck for 9 years,

361
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:12,576
Oversaw 80 clients,
filed hundreds of tax returns,

362
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:14,259
and fought 27 audits.

363
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,380
Now, in light of your recently
discovered fraud,

364
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,431
all of that can now
be called into question.

365
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,356
Therefore, you are being sued
for nine years back pay,

366
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:26,604
Plus any expenses incurred
to mitigate the damage you've done.

367
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:28,236
This is...

368
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,275
This would bankrupt me.

369
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:33,778
Or you can take
what's behind door number two.

370
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,409
- It's Aberdeen.
- Who?

371
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:42,104
It's not a who. It's a what.
Drybeck is doing business with them

372
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,923
and I think that's
where the problem lies.

373
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:46,654
You don't get it!
I'm only leaving with one of these,

374
00:18:46,737 --> 00:18:49,679
and if it's the lawsuit,
the first thing your friends upstairs

375
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,921
are gonna ask you for
is a big, fat retainer.

376
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,335
And when you tell them
that Harvey Specter is the one

377
00:18:54,418 --> 00:18:57,041
that's suing you, you're gonna watch
the color drain from their faces.

378
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,798
Now what would you like to do?

379
00:19:04,826 --> 00:19:06,011
This is not cool.

380
00:19:06,262 --> 00:19:09,195
You leave me in your apartment all night
and say you're gonna be right back.

381
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:11,316
You don't even thank me
for dropping off your suit.

382
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,235
I had a bad day, Jenny.

383
00:19:13,422 --> 00:19:16,029
- So you couldn't call me?
- I almost got fired, OK?

384
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:18,114
What happened?

385
00:19:19,168 --> 00:19:20,894
It's not worth explaining.

386
00:19:22,814 --> 00:19:25,714
I need to find evidence that our
accountingn firm is up to something,

387
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:28,284
so I found this woman who fid
a wrongful termination suit

388
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,427
against them, but then
she referred me to her lawyer.

389
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,789
- Did you call them?
- Yeah, but they're this huge firm.

390
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:35,925
Unger and Macy.
They wouldn't take my call.

391
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,108
Why not?

392
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,636
There's a confidentiality clause
in the settlement, for one.

393
00:19:40,436 --> 00:19:41,436
So?

394
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:45,070
So it means that they can't share
details like that.

395
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:47,623
I thought all lawyers
secretly shared that stuff.

396
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:50,630
You're all in the same club, right?

397
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,431
What?
That's not a dumb thing to assume.

398
00:19:55,514 --> 00:19:58,113
That's not dumb at all, because...

399
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:05,161
Unger and Macy have almost as many
harvard grads as we do, which means...

400
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,948
They're gonna be
at the mixer tonight.

401
00:20:07,031 --> 00:20:08,957
There are two things
that lawyers love to do.

402
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,500
Drink and talk.

403
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,132
- Hi.
- Hi.

404
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:17,001
Mike Ross, class of 2011.

405
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,443
Sorry, I don't have u on here.
Do you have your I.D.?

406
00:20:20,526 --> 00:20:23,429
- I can run it through the computer.
- My harvard I.D.?

407
00:20:24,127 --> 00:20:25,932
What did you say your name
was again?

408
00:20:26,568 --> 00:20:28,601
Michael Ross of Pearson Hardman.

409
00:20:29,777 --> 00:20:33,170
You think they ask Harvey for his I.D.
When he comes to this place?

410
00:20:33,888 --> 00:20:37,541
Harvey Specter?
You work with Harvey Specter?

411
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,028
I'm his associate.

412
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:42,980
I can call him if you like.

413
00:20:43,063 --> 00:20:46,060
Just don't tell him
I gave you any trouble, okay?

414
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,456
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

415
00:20:51,957 --> 00:20:54,143
Oh, god.
I'm never gonna survive this.

416
00:20:54,226 --> 00:20:57,067
Deep breaths.
You'll be fine.

417
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,733
I saw the signed severance
papers on my desk.

418
00:21:12,816 --> 00:21:14,864
- Thank you.
- And I also left word for Tori.

419
00:21:14,947 --> 00:21:16,065
Yes, we spoke.

420
00:21:16,148 --> 00:21:19,235
She's relieved, but I wouldn't go so far
as to say completely forgiving.

421
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:21,737
You ever heard
of Aberdeen Solutions?

422
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,284
Drybeck listed them
as a consultant firm.

423
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,492
They bill us every month
for their management services.

424
00:21:27,926 --> 00:21:29,234
What does that mean?

425
00:21:29,494 --> 00:21:31,581
- Check with accounting.
- I did.

426
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:33,755
They can only tell me
how much we pay them,

427
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,856
So I called Aberdeen directly.

428
00:21:36,107 --> 00:21:37,948
It's an automated answering system.

429
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:40,256
I left six messages.
No returns.

430
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,801
Stan mentioned it.
Something just doesn't feel right.

431
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,388
Are you saying you want
to investigate our client?

432
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,558
- They're also our accountants.
- And Tori is also a friend.

433
00:21:52,536 --> 00:21:55,438
- Harvey, if you got caught...
- I wouldn't get caught.

434
00:21:58,252 --> 00:22:02,028
I am explicitly telling you
not to do this.

435
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,866
Then I'll let you know what I don't find
after I don't look into it.

436
00:22:12,478 --> 00:22:13,478
{\pub}

437
00:22:22,081 --> 00:22:25,268
Hey, should we get the rest
of the 2010 grads with us for a pic?

438
00:22:25,562 --> 00:22:27,330
The rest?
This is 2011. No way.

439
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:29,398
Isn't he from the 2010 class?

440
00:22:33,843 --> 00:22:35,937
No, no.
I was 2011.

441
00:22:36,831 --> 00:22:40,378
You're not with us.
Yeah, Rudy... It's Mike.

442
00:22:40,937 --> 00:22:42,218
We hung out a bunch.

443
00:22:42,301 --> 00:22:43,361
Where?

444
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:45,278
You know what?

445
00:22:45,361 --> 00:22:47,865
Maybe I'm thinking about somebody else.
Sorry about that.

446
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:50,926
Has anyone seen that guy
here before?

447
00:22:55,177 --> 00:22:57,589
- I'm not having any luck.
- Wish I could say different, love.

448
00:22:57,672 --> 00:22:59,669
But it's been
a Potter's field for me too.

449
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:02,400
You get to pretend to be
someone else.

450
00:23:02,483 --> 00:23:03,965
I wanted to try.
It's fun.

451
00:23:04,242 --> 00:23:05,799
Accent?

452
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:08,806
Okay, I'll stop.

453
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:12,015
- What?
- You're amazing.

454
00:23:16,137 --> 00:23:17,562
And that's Brian Jennings.

455
00:23:18,057 --> 00:23:19,291
Who's Brian Jennings?

456
00:23:19,374 --> 00:23:21,546
I saw his face
on Unger and Macy's website today.

457
00:23:21,806 --> 00:23:23,401
What are you waiting for?
Go.

458
00:23:30,624 --> 00:23:31,624
Hi.

459
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,540
Ten days for public exposure.

460
00:23:35,058 --> 00:23:38,287
Next time you need a bathroom
in Times Square, go into a hotel.

461
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:42,096
Five-minute recess.

462
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,707
Harvey.

463
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,490
Long time, Anthony.

464
00:23:51,643 --> 00:23:54,746
You keep company
with the high rollers on center street.

465
00:23:55,151 --> 00:23:57,002
What are you doing down
in night court?

466
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:58,770
I need a favor.

467
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:01,187
What kind of favor?

468
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,358
One that requires access
to sealed court documents.

469
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:06,215
Can it wait till tomorrow?
I got this backlog of case...

470
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:08,775
When you came to me two years
ago in the middle of the night,

471
00:24:08,858 --> 00:24:11,157
did I tell you
it had to wait till tomorrow?

472
00:24:13,241 --> 00:24:14,831
My chambers.

473
00:24:17,578 --> 00:24:20,219
So... This is quite a surprise.

474
00:24:20,469 --> 00:24:22,629
Who'd ever think that you
and I would on a double date?

475
00:24:22,822 --> 00:24:24,256
- Excuse me?
- Come on.

476
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:26,975
You had to notice when you walked
in the room. She's absolutely gorgeous.

477
00:24:27,293 --> 00:24:29,762
And she's completely infatuated
with your girlfriend.

478
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,805
Come on.
Come on, I'll introduce you to her.

479
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,834
Charisse, honey...

480
00:24:35,917 --> 00:24:38,087
This is one of my associates.

481
00:24:38,347 --> 00:24:41,139
So nice to meet you.
And I'm in love with your date.

482
00:24:41,328 --> 00:24:42,313
Seriously.

483
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,585
She's just been telling me about
her work with monkeys.

484
00:24:44,668 --> 00:24:47,878
It's fascinating.
So really, they're as smart as us?

485
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,491
Oh, smarter.

486
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:52,025
I never had a chance with him.

487
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,035
I need to use the ladie's room.
Would you excuse me?

488
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,763
Monkeys aren't smarter
than humans, sorry.

489
00:25:00,563 --> 00:25:02,832
That depends on which humans
you're talking about, I guess.

490
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:03,626
What?

491
00:25:04,648 --> 00:25:06,198
Name of case and rough date?

492
00:25:06,626 --> 00:25:09,715
Erdeen versus Paula O'Neill,
say six months ago.

493
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:12,471
Let's see.

494
00:25:12,737 --> 00:25:15,007
Says here that they were listed
as a subsidiary

495
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,238
of Drybeck in a wrongful
termination suit.

496
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:18,766
{\*That's it.}That's what I'm looking for.

497
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,812
I can't print this out.
I'll get tagged.

498
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:22,367
Come around.
Take a look.

499
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,251
- Is that what you're after?
- That's it.

500
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,442
But what's that?

501
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:35,271
That links to another court filing
in relation to Aberdeen.

502
00:25:35,354 --> 00:25:36,507
Click on it.

503
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,662
Says here
that they filed for dissolution...

504
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,200
Earlier today.

505
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:44,036
- The whole company?
- That's what it says.

506
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:47,211
- They're officially shut down.
- I'm gonna need one more favor.

507
00:25:50,094 --> 00:25:52,128
I think it's great that you found
someone not in law

508
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:53,885
who works out in the real world.

509
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:56,784
- Why do you say that?
- Because I'm stuck in a suit all day

510
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:58,639
Or an office or a courtroom.

511
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,132
- I think it'd be nice to be in nature.
- Don't you, Mike?

512
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,977
I love that you're a lawyer.

513
00:26:03,272 --> 00:26:07,111
In fact, I'd love to see
where you work sometime.

514
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,964
You would?

515
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:13,029
I'm not feeling so well
all of a sudden.

516
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,577
- No.
- Yeah. You think we can go?

517
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:17,200
- Rright now?
- Now.

518
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:19,191
- So great to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you.

519
00:26:19,274 --> 00:26:20,473
Have good night.

520
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,210
Why didn't you do that sooner?

521
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:27,274
Because I had to get this first.

522
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:30,165
That's the guy, right? From the firm.
That's his employee I.D.

523
00:26:30,248 --> 00:26:32,052
- He gave this to you?
- No, I stole it.

524
00:26:33,228 --> 00:26:34,074
What?

525
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:36,757
Listen, you could spend all night
trying to get to the guy

526
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,388
or you could just go
into his firm yourself and look.

527
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:42,017
- Come on.
- Let's go.

528
00:26:49,332 --> 00:26:51,442
I can barely keep
my eyes open myself.

529
00:26:51,982 --> 00:26:54,237
Filing briefs sucks.

530
00:27:13,946 --> 00:27:15,534
{\pub}

531
00:27:19,546 --> 00:27:21,180
You actually came.

532
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:24,308
You must be Harvey Specter.

533
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:27,090
"Joe," was it?

534
00:27:27,173 --> 00:27:29,309
Your friend fill you in on the deal
that's on the table?

535
00:27:29,392 --> 00:27:30,833
Let me just get it straight.

536
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,733
You caught him rifling
through some files,

537
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,319
and in lieu of calling the police,
you want me to pay you off?

538
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,406
- I never said that.
- He did.

539
00:27:39,434 --> 00:27:42,368
That's great. This way, if I level
a charge of extortion,

540
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:43,817
It's hearsay...

541
00:27:44,087 --> 00:27:46,581
Ten years working for a law firm,
you learn a thing or two,

542
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:49,395
which is good, 'cause you sure as
hell don't make a lot of money doing it.

543
00:27:49,478 --> 00:27:51,303
Somehow I think
you're getting by fine.

544
00:27:51,386 --> 00:27:53,277
Just saying,
on the level you guys play at,

545
00:27:53,461 --> 00:27:56,294
Espionage happens all the time,
which is why I know

546
00:27:56,377 --> 00:27:58,349
you'll do anything
to protect your secrets.

547
00:27:58,432 --> 00:28:01,779
Actually, Joe Speena,
of 2561 Clover lane,

548
00:28:01,862 --> 00:28:03,963
Astoria, queens,
I think we all would.

549
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,638
Like those tax returns
you filed jointly

550
00:28:06,721 --> 00:28:09,515
for the last six years
while no longer living with your wife.

551
00:28:09,598 --> 00:28:11,689
You know, the IRS
can destroy you for that.

552
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,780
You think you're the first
person to try to extort me, Joe?

553
00:28:14,863 --> 00:28:16,444
'cause that's the level I play at.

554
00:28:16,853 --> 00:28:20,489
Now... You're a security guard
Who likes to take risks.

555
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,783
I like that.
So here's what we're gonna do.

556
00:28:23,187 --> 00:28:26,697
This here's a generous donation
to Joey junior's little league team.

557
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,486
Now, if it gets to them,
it gets to them.

558
00:28:28,569 --> 00:28:30,207
If it doesn't, it doesn't.

559
00:28:30,766 --> 00:28:33,919
But the next time we talk,
it's gonna be me who wants a favor.

560
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:40,672
Officer.

561
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:43,491
Do I really need to pay you back?

562
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:45,525
Let's start with an explanation.

563
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,263
You said I needed to find evidence,
so I went to find some.

564
00:28:48,346 --> 00:28:50,147
By breaking into another law firm?

565
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,329
Is that really worse than
paying off a security guard?

566
00:28:52,412 --> 00:28:54,017
First of all, I didn't pay him off.

567
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,007
Second of all, if I hadn't paid him off,
You'd be in jail right now.

568
00:28:58,096 --> 00:28:59,754
You think I might
be right about Stan.

569
00:28:59,985 --> 00:29:02,745
No, I never said you were wrong.
I said we needed evidence.

570
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:04,933
But did you find something?

571
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:09,174
Drybeck bought
a shelf company 13 months ago.

572
00:29:09,444 --> 00:29:11,063
What's a shelf company?

573
00:29:11,323 --> 00:29:13,837
It's a corporation
that exists only on paper,

574
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,042
So its owners can hide their assets.

575
00:29:16,249 --> 00:29:19,281
- Isn't that a shell company?
- No, it's a shelf company.

576
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:23,518
Take a shell company, give it a bank
account, credit history, tax returns,

577
00:29:23,836 --> 00:29:26,930
and let it season
for years on a shelf.

578
00:29:27,013 --> 00:29:29,454
Someone buys it,
slot their name into it,

579
00:29:29,537 --> 00:29:32,324
and they walk away
with an established corporation

580
00:29:32,407 --> 00:29:33,782
with a preexisting history.

581
00:29:34,091 --> 00:29:36,941
Anyone looks any closer,
they shut it down and do it again.

582
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,727
- That's legal?
- Shelf companies are legal.

583
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,609
I'm guessing what Tori's doing
with hers isn't.

584
00:29:42,692 --> 00:29:44,466
Wait a minute.
Is it called "Aberdeen"?

585
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:48,402
I saw it on the top of this list
with 37 other management companies

586
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:53,490
all related to Drybeck
in that wrongful termination suit.

587
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,392
When we get back to the office,
I want you to find legal precedent

588
00:29:56,475 --> 00:29:58,466
that will allow us
to subpoena the records.

589
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:59,806
Okay, on it.

590
00:30:00,028 --> 00:30:01,549
Do I really have to pay you back?

591
00:30:01,994 --> 00:30:04,336
- Every penny.
- Wait a minute.

592
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:06,262
How much was in that envelope?

593
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:17,253
- What are you all doing at my desk?
- Dude, you got to check this out.

594
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,284
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

595
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,458
- Is that Louis?
- In the lobby.

596
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:29,601
Is this a security camera?
A live feed?

597
00:30:29,684 --> 00:30:31,732
- What are you guys doing?
- This is from last night.

598
00:30:31,815 --> 00:30:34,091
The guys in security emailed it
up to Louis this morning.

599
00:30:34,174 --> 00:30:36,354
And why are we watching it
on my computer?

600
00:30:36,437 --> 00:30:38,356
We're not gonna risk watching it
on one of ours.

601
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:41,626
- And everyone knows your password.
- How does everybody know my password?

602
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:44,468
"Ross999."
How hard is that to crack?

603
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,856
- "999" increases the odds of...
- Here it comes.

604
00:30:49,438 --> 00:30:50,438
What?

605
00:30:56,841 --> 00:30:58,268
What did he say to her?

606
00:30:58,746 --> 00:31:00,608
Evidently Louis wants
a restraining order

607
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:02,599
and he needs this asvidence.

608
00:31:03,076 --> 00:31:04,076
What?

609
00:31:07,664 --> 00:31:11,468
Okay, listen. Please don't.
I came in here and it...

610
00:31:12,086 --> 00:31:14,955
Look, I...
Are you okay now?

611
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:24,757
If the message you left was
another trick to get me down here...

612
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,470
No tricks, I assure you. Come on in.

613
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:29,178
- Stan, I'm Jessica Pearson.
- I know who you are.

614
00:31:29,523 --> 00:31:32,299
You said if I accepted the severance
agreement, there wouldn't be a lawsuit.

615
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:34,099
Well, there is one,

616
00:31:34,564 --> 00:31:36,810
But not against you.
With you.

617
00:31:37,357 --> 00:31:40,689
We know about Aberdeen.
We know what Tori was orchestrating.

618
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,067
And with your help,
we can expose her.

619
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:48,357
Why should I help you?

620
00:31:48,955 --> 00:31:50,699
What have you got to lose?

621
00:31:56,301 --> 00:31:58,537
Tell me what you need me to do.

622
00:32:05,655 --> 00:32:07,591
What does he have you trying
to find this time?

623
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,300
You really want to know?

624
00:32:12,423 --> 00:32:16,225
I managed to get a look at some files
involving our accounting firm.

625
00:32:16,883 --> 00:32:18,394
What's up with our accounting firm?

626
00:32:18,823 --> 00:32:20,354
They're stealing from us.

627
00:32:21,724 --> 00:32:24,403
You know your phone bill?
You have all those surcharges,

628
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:26,647
you have no idea what they mean,
but you pay 'em anyway.

629
00:32:27,202 --> 00:32:28,794
Drybeck's doing
the same thing to us,

630
00:32:28,877 --> 00:32:31,407
except all their charges
are a complete scam.

631
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:33,518
Pretty sure
that phone charges are scam too.

632
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:36,739
- Maybe.
- So what do you need?

633
00:32:37,325 --> 00:32:39,656
I need a legal reason
to get those files

634
00:32:39,739 --> 00:32:42,403
without saying I saw those files.

635
00:32:42,943 --> 00:32:45,082
You need them for court
or you just need them?

636
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:47,965
Why?

637
00:32:48,436 --> 00:32:50,384
- You said you read 'em, right?
- Yeah.

638
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,127
So then you already have them...

639
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,345
In here.

640
00:32:54,947 --> 00:32:58,517
- You're right. I do.
- Yes, so you dictate, I'll type.

641
00:32:59,313 --> 00:33:00,313
What?

642
00:33:00,648 --> 00:33:02,325
You'd actually do that for me?

643
00:33:02,408 --> 00:33:05,631
They're stealing from us.
Person Hardman is my firm too.

644
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:07,901
Come on.

645
00:33:10,866 --> 00:33:15,034
With the party of the third part,
here to referred to as Norton LLC...

646
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:19,496
... a claim that might
reasonably be anticipated...

647
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,466
We acknowledge that such appointment
is irrevocable and shall be deemed...

648
00:33:23,053 --> 00:33:25,889
Lawfully invested with the power
to make such contracts

649
00:33:25,972 --> 00:33:30,690
or to perform acts from which
can be lawfully implied.

650
00:33:31,789 --> 00:33:33,222
That's it.
Did we get it?

651
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:36,744
Saving and wait for it...
Done.

652
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:45,401
What?

653
00:33:45,928 --> 00:33:49,121
- Your mind.
- It's just amazing.

654
00:33:49,874 --> 00:33:51,124
Thanks.

655
00:33:52,765 --> 00:33:55,366
- What?
- Your mind's amazing too.

656
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,705
Oh, thank you.

657
00:34:00,562 --> 00:34:02,264
Who you calling this late?

658
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,502
- She's waiting up for you?
- Guess you're right. It's pretty late.

659
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,296
She's probably sleeping by now.
I'll just text her.

660
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:13,731
It's tough to have a relationship
with the first year or any year.

661
00:34:13,814 --> 00:34:17,096
You just don't have a life.
How'd you make it work?

662
00:34:17,675 --> 00:34:19,179
Who said I did?

663
00:34:19,487 --> 00:34:21,960
It's impossible to have anything
long-term unless you find someone

664
00:34:22,043 --> 00:34:25,276
that has the same 80-hour
work week and then...

665
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,042
that doesn't work either,
because they're busy too.

666
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:31,333
I'm not gonna let that be the reason
that Jenny and I don't...

667
00:34:43,821 --> 00:34:45,315
What are you two still doing here?

668
00:34:45,681 --> 00:34:47,074
- It's for Harvey.
- Nothing.

669
00:34:47,334 --> 00:34:48,752
- But we're done.
- Good night.

670
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,486
- I'll see you later.
- Good night.

671
00:34:56,243 --> 00:34:59,993
I'm sure you're aware of this,
but I'm just gonna remind you anyway.

672
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:03,575
This office frowns upon
relationships in the workplace.

673
00:35:15,603 --> 00:35:16,363
{\pub}

674
00:35:28,413 --> 00:35:30,196
Oh, god!
I'm so sorry.

675
00:35:30,543 --> 00:35:31,795
That's okay.

676
00:35:34,005 --> 00:35:35,632
Thank you for last night.

677
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,431
- The typing.
- Of course... right.

678
00:35:39,778 --> 00:35:41,590
- Absolutely.
- It was really helpful.

679
00:35:44,265 --> 00:35:46,077
Hold on one second. Sorry.

680
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:48,771
I said I needed you in my office.

681
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:51,902
- And I said I was on my way.
- Save it. Those the files?

682
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:53,075
Take them, please.

683
00:35:53,158 --> 00:35:55,274
Stan is in my office.
Meet us in the conference room.

684
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,409
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- That's okay.

685
00:36:02,908 --> 00:36:05,583
I got your email
with a list of other law firms.

686
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:08,624
I respect your effort to make amends
by referring new clients.

687
00:36:08,908 --> 00:36:10,642
That wasn't a list
for client referrals.

688
00:36:10,725 --> 00:36:12,878
Those are firms you should
consider for representation.

689
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,671
We're no longer
your attorneys, Tori.

690
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:17,072
- What?
- We have no choice really.

691
00:36:17,155 --> 00:36:19,061
It would be impossible
to represent you

692
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:21,787
when we plan on suing you
for every penny you've got.

693
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,640
- Is this a joke?
- Aberdeen Solutions.

694
00:36:24,994 --> 00:36:28,434
Created in June of 2006.
Sold to Drybeck 2010.

695
00:36:28,517 --> 00:36:30,044
Dissolveo days ago.

696
00:36:30,237 --> 00:36:32,523
Before that, it was Bolton Finances.

697
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,285
And before that, it was
Norton Services, Littleton LLC.

698
00:36:35,368 --> 00:36:37,629
- Where did you get those?
- We know what you did, Tori.

699
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:39,471
You couldn't have
subpoenaed these files.

700
00:36:39,554 --> 00:36:40,940
And yet we have them.

701
00:36:41,023 --> 00:36:42,635
Take a look.
They're all there.

702
00:36:42,718 --> 00:36:44,451
- Now we have proof.
- Proof of what?

703
00:36:44,783 --> 00:36:46,829
Those are all legitimate
corporations used for...

704
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:48,956
Stealing money
and lining your own pockets.

705
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:51,153
But don't take my word for it.

706
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:52,251
Guys?

707
00:36:58,791 --> 00:36:59,948
Hello, Tori.

708
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,387
We hired Stan to do a little
independent consulting on our behalf

709
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,986
and he's come
with some very interesting connections.

710
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:08,892
It was easy,
even if I don't really have a degree.

711
00:37:09,716 --> 00:37:12,646
There was that vacation
you invited me on last year...

712
00:37:12,858 --> 00:37:14,853
To your new house in the bahamas.

713
00:37:14,936 --> 00:37:17,833
A house you bought with money
you stole from this firm.

714
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:19,799
My firm.

715
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,781
- Jessica...
- "Jessica" what?

716
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:26,630
You can't use any of this.
We have attorney-client privilege.

717
00:37:26,823 --> 00:37:28,453
With Drybeck Accounting, yes.

718
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,914
With the shelf companies?
No.

719
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,483
And unfortunately for you,
you're listed on the shelf companies.

720
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:35,786
You stole from me.

721
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,834
You either come clean now
or the only time

722
00:37:38,917 --> 00:37:40,928
you'll see your children
in the next decade

723
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:43,586
will be during
prison visiting hours.

724
00:37:48,591 --> 00:37:50,387
So I'm gonna get
my job back now, right?

725
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:53,294
- I don't see why not.
- No, Stan, you're not.

726
00:37:54,592 --> 00:37:55,396
What?

727
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:57,774
Drybeck's going bankrupt
after this all shakes out.

728
00:37:58,087 --> 00:38:00,110
Even if they don't,
they're not gonna hire you back.

729
00:38:00,908 --> 00:38:02,058
Why?

730
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,412
Because you falsified your resume.

731
00:38:08,913 --> 00:38:10,387
What am I supposed to do now?

732
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:13,006
We just got your more
than your severance package.

733
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,584
I suggest you use it
to tide yourself over

734
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,696
till you figure something out.

735
00:38:30,134 --> 00:38:31,677
Stan... Hey.

736
00:38:33,003 --> 00:38:35,183
Your best asset is your mind.

737
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:39,566
- They can't take that from you.
- One little mistake.

738
00:38:40,342 --> 00:38:43,695
You could go back to school,
become legitimate.

739
00:38:44,162 --> 00:38:45,656
Start over?

740
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:52,307
I never should have done it.

741
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,802
Told you they wouldn't catch me.

742
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,609
What are you looking for?

743
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:20,767
- Positive reinforcement?
- Nothing major.

744
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,484
A trophy, Nobel.

745
00:39:22,814 --> 00:39:25,070
Wod your likeness in bronze
in the lobby be okay?

746
00:39:25,513 --> 00:39:27,239
Bust or life-size?

747
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,924
You did a good thing, Harvey.

748
00:39:30,695 --> 00:39:32,494
It wasn't just me, you know?

749
00:39:33,635 --> 00:39:36,840
Then I guess I should give the kid
the benefit of the doubt from now on.

750
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:39,626
You should.

751
00:39:55,163 --> 00:39:57,669
You'll be happy to know that Stan
has no idea what he's gonna do

752
00:39:57,752 --> 00:39:59,051
with the rest of his life.

753
00:39:59,134 --> 00:40:00,856
That doesn't make me happy.

754
00:40:02,915 --> 00:40:05,817
What if I tell you I have no idea
What I'm doing with mine?

755
00:40:09,036 --> 00:40:11,619
What the hell are we gonna do
when I get caught, Harvey?

756
00:40:12,308 --> 00:40:14,745
- You're not gonna get caught.
- That's your answer?

757
00:40:17,479 --> 00:40:19,041
What else is there?

758
00:40:22,771 --> 00:40:23,985
Why?

759
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,716
- What?
- Hire me. Why would you do that to me?

760
00:40:29,012 --> 00:40:30,621
- You mean for you.
- No, I don't.

761
00:40:30,704 --> 00:40:33,101
You made it perfectly clear
that you only do things for yourself.

762
00:40:33,184 --> 00:40:34,184
So why?

763
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:36,713
You mean the reason
why I became a lawyer

764
00:40:36,796 --> 00:40:39,345
or your friend dealt drugs
or you used to cheat?

765
00:40:39,428 --> 00:40:41,063
I cheated because I needed...

766
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:43,688
You couldn't make money any other way?
Bullshit....

767
00:40:44,054 --> 00:40:46,351
Life is this.

768
00:40:47,372 --> 00:40:48,820
I like this.

769
00:40:49,775 --> 00:40:51,281
That's not me.

770
00:40:51,605 --> 00:40:53,596
If it wasn't me,
you wouldn't be here.

771
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:56,388
So if you want this to stop,
all you got to do is tap out.

772
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:13,773
You're here to see Mike.

773
00:41:13,995 --> 00:41:15,917
We're gonna celebrate his victory.

774
00:41:19,371 --> 00:41:21,457
I actually think that it's a really,

775
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,571
really good idea that
you've come to pick him up.

776
00:41:23,654 --> 00:41:25,994
In fact, if I were you,
I'd do it a little more often.

777
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,402
Just all those late nights
working with Rachel.

778
00:41:30,704 --> 00:41:33,262
- What do you mean?
- What do I...

779
