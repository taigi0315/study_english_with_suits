# Implementation Roadmap
**Generated:** 2025-01-30
**Architect:** Architect Agent

## Executive Summary
- Total tickets approved: 5
- Estimated timeline: 3-4 weeks (2 sprints)
- Critical path: TICKET-003 → TICKET-001 → TICKET-004
- Key milestones: Critical bug fix (Week 1), Service layer refactoring (Week 2), Code quality improvements (Week 3-4)

## Strategic Context
This implementation plan addresses:
1. **Critical Bug Fix** - TICKET-003 (1 ticket)
2. **Foundation Refactoring** - TICKET-001, TICKET-002 (2 tickets)
3. **Code Quality Improvements** - TICKET-004, TICKET-005 (2 tickets)

### Architectural Vision
Where we're headed:
- **Unified Service Layer**: Single source of truth for video processing pipeline
- **Standardized Resource Management**: Consistent patterns for temp files and error handling
- **Reduced Technical Debt**: Eliminated code duplication, improved maintainability
- **Better Reliability**: Automatic cleanup, structured error handling, automatic retry

### Expected Outcomes
After completing this roadmap:
- **Code Reduction**: ~500 lines of duplicate code eliminated
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for video processing, easier to modify and extend
- **Reliability**: Automatic temp file cleanup, structured error handling, better debugging
- **Quality**: Consistent filename sanitization, unified error handling patterns

## Phase 0: Immediate (This Week)
**Focus:** Critical bug fix
**Duration:** 1 day

### TICKET-003: Fix Undefined Variable Bug in get_job_expressions Endpoint
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Effort:** < 2 hours
- **Why now:** Runtime error breaks API endpoint, blocks users from accessing expression results
- **Owner:** Any developer (straightforward fix)
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Success metric:** Endpoint works without NameError, tests pass

**Implementation:**
- Replace `jobs_db` with Redis usage (same pattern as other endpoints)
- Add integration tests for endpoint
- Verify Redis job data structure

**Rollback:** Simple revert if issues arise

---

## Phase 1: Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2)
**Focus:** Foundation refactoring - service layer and resource management
**Duration:** 2 weeks
**Dependencies:** Phase 0 complete

### Implementation Sequence

#### Week 1
1. **TICKET-001: Extract Pipeline Logic from API Task**
   - Effort: 2-3 days
   - Depends on: Phase 0 complete
   - Blocks: TICKET-004
   - Why first: Largest code duplication, foundation for other improvements
   
   **Key Deliverables:**

   - `process_video_task` reduced from 450+ lines to ~100 lines
   - API and CLI both use unified service
   - Progress callbacks integrated with Redis job updates
   - `pipeline_runner.py` evaluated and fixed or removed
   
   **Success Criteria:**
   - All existing tests pass
   - Integration tests verify identical results from API and CLI
   - Code duplication reduced by 80%+

2. **TICKET-002: Standardize Temp File Management**
   - Effort: 1-2 days
   - Depends on: None (can work in parallel with TICKET-001)
   - Can parallel with: TICKET-001 (coordinate for integration)
   - Why now: Prevents disk space leaks, improves reliability
   
   **Key Deliverables:**
   - `TempFileManager` utility created

## Phase 2: Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4)
**Focus:** Code quality improvements - filename sanitization and error handling
**Duration:** 2 weeks
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 complete

### Implementation Sequence

#### Week 3
3. **TICKET-004: Consolidate Filename Sanitization**
   - Effort: < 1 day
   - Depends on: TICKET-001 complete (service layer established)
   - Blocks: None
   - Why now: Code quality improvement, security enhancement, follows TICKET-001
   
   **Key Deliverables:**
   - `filename_utils.py` utility created
   - All filename sanitization consolidated
   - Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Comprehensive edge case tests
   
   **Success Criteria:**
   - All filename sanitization uses unified utility
   - Expression matching verified (critical for video workflow)
   - Cross-platform compatibility verified

#### Week 4
4. **TICKET-005: Integrate Error Handler**
   - Effort: 2-3 days
   - Depends on: TICKET-001 complete (service layer for integration)
   - Blocks: None
   - Why now: Leverages existing investment, improves reliability
   
   **Key Deliverables:**
   - Core workflows use error handler (expression analysis, video processing)
   - Custom retry logic replaced with error_handler
   - Error reports generated with context
   - API endpoints integrated (gradual)
   
   **Success Criteria:**
   - Core workflows use error handler
   - Retry logic tested with various failure scenarios
   - Error reports generated with useful context
   - Performance impact < 5%

**Phase 2 Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Filename sanitization consolidated and tested
- [ ] Error handler integrated in core workflows
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated

**Phase 2 Risks:**
- Risk: Filename format changes break lookups
  - Mitigation: Expression matching verified, comprehensive tests
- Risk: Error handler changes behavior
  - Mitigation: Gradual integration, verify existing behavior preserved

## Dependency Graph
```
TICKET-003 (Phase 0)
  └─> TICKET-001 (Phase 1, Week 1)
       └─> TICKET-004 (Phase 2, Week 3)
       └─> TICKET-005 (Phase 2, Week 4)
       
TICKET-002 (Phase 1, Week 1)
  └─> Can integrate with TICKET-001 service layer
  └─> TICKET-005 can use for temp file cleanup errors
```

## Critical Path
The longest dependency chain:
1. TICKET-003 → TICKET-001 → TICKET-004
   Total: ~2.5 weeks

**Timeline Impact:**
Cannot complete TICKET-004 before Week 3 due to dependency on TICKET-001.

---

## Resource Requirements
**Skills needed:**
- Backend engineer: 2-3 weeks (TICKET-001, TICKET-005)
- Mid-level engineer: 1-2 weeks (TICKET-002, TICKET-004)
- Any developer: < 1 day (TICKET-003)

**Infrastructure needs:**
- None (all code changes)

---

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Tickets
1. **TICKET-001:** Breaking API behavior
   - Impact if fails: Users unable to process videos via API
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive integration tests, ensure response format unchanged
   - Contingency: Keep old `process_video_task` as backup until fully tested

### Rollback Strategy
For each phase:
- **Phase 0:** Simple revert - restore old code (though it was broken)
- **Phase 1:** Keep old implementations until fully tested - gradual migration
- **Phase 2:** Can revert individual integrations if issues arise

---

## Success Metrics

### Short-term (After Phase 1)
- Code duplication reduced by 80%+ (from ~500 lines)
- Temp file cleanup verified (no disk leaks)
- Service layer established and tested
- Performance impact < 5%

### Long-term (After All Phases)
- Single source of truth for video processing pipeline
- Consistent error handling patterns across codebase
- Improved maintainability (easier to add features)
- Better debugging capabilities (error reports, temp file tracking)

---

## Review Checkpoints
**After Phase 0:** Verify critical bug fix deployed and working
**After Phase 1:** Measure code reduction, verify service layer stability, adjust Phase 2 if needed
**After Phase 2:** Evaluate code quality improvements, measure error handling effectiveness
**Monthly:** Review progress against roadmap, adjust priorities if needed

## Notes for Engineering Team

### Coordination Points
- **TICKET-001 & TICKET-002:** Coordinate on temp file management integration in new service layer
- **TICKET-001 & TICKET-004:** Coordinate on filename sanitization usage in new service
- **TICKET-001 & TICKET-005:** Coordinate on error handler integration in new service

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Each ticket includes unit tests
- **Integration Tests:** Critical for TICKET-001 (verify API/CLI identical results)
- **Regression Tests:** Run full test suite after each phase

### Documentation Updates
- Update `docs/api/README.md` after TICKET-001 (service layer)
- Update `docs/core/README.md` after TICKET-001 (pipeline service)
- Add examples for new utilities (TICKET-002, TICKET-004)

### Patterns to Follow
- **Service Layer Pattern:** TICKET-001 establishes pattern
- **Context Manager Pattern:** TICKET-002 establishes pattern
- **Utility Pattern:** TICKET-004 establishes pattern
- **Decorator Pattern:** TICKET-005 uses for error handling
