## Impact Assessment
**Business Impact:**
- Expression repeating segment sometimes has no audio, or outputs fail to generate ‚Üí unusable content and wasted time.

**Technical Impact:**
- Affects `langflix/core/video_editor.py` (short/long pipelines), `langflix/media/ffmpeg_utils.py` (concat/repeat/stack), layout logic, and validation scripts.

**Effort Estimate:**
- Medium (1-3 days)

## Problem Description

### Current State
**Location:**
- `langflix/core/video_editor.py`
- `langflix/media/ffmpeg_utils.py`
- `tools/verify_media_pipeline.py`

Current symptoms:
- Expression repeating video plays but has no audio.
- In some runs, both long and short outputs are not created.
- Errors observed:
  - `Encountered format('yuv420p') ... a split filter is probably required`
  - `ffmpeg error (see stderr output for detail)`

Why it's problematic:
- Filter-based repetition can cause filter-graph label conflicts and implicit mapping issues; mixing mapping/volume/format in one step makes graphs fragile, leading to audio drops or failures.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Expression repetition uses filter-concat with reused upstream nodes (needs split), and complex chains (format/stack/volume/map) amplify conflicts.
- Final stage applies mapping + volume in one step ‚Üí higher chance of map/filter_complex mismatch.

### Evidence
- Multiple jobs where expression loop has no audio.
- Repeated filter errors while building repeated AV or final mux.

## Proposed Solution

### Approach
1. Replace filter-based expression repetition with demuxer-concat of AV segments (file-list) to avoid filter graph conflicts; keep original audio intact.
2. Build a single concatenated AV (context + expression-loop AV) first.
3. Layout:
   - Long-form: hstack(left=AV, right=slide), slide visible full time; audio from AV only.
   - Short-form: vstack(top=AV, bottom=slide), slide visible full time; audio from AV only.
4. Final audio gain (+25%) applied as a separate 2-pass step (simple map), not inside filter_complex.
5. No silence synthesis or mid-pipeline resampling; keep audio untouched until final gain.
6. Add ffprobe-based checks to verify audio presence/params per intermediate/final outputs.

### Implementation Details
```text
langflix/media/ffmpeg_utils.py
- build_repeated_av (filter-concat)
+ repeat_av_demuxer (demuxer-concat, AV preserved)

- concat_filter_with_explicit_map (complex)
+ concat_demuxer_if_uniform where possible; else minimal filter-concat with explicit v=1,a=1

langflix/core/video_editor.py
- Filter-based repetition & single-step map+volume
+ Extract expr 1x AV ‚Üí repeat via demuxer concat ‚Üí concat context+expr AV (demuxer) ‚Üí
  hstack (long) or vstack (short) with slide (full time). Audio from AV only.
+ Final pass: apply volume=1.25 to audio then mux.
```

### Alternative Approaches Considered
- Keep filter-concat and add explicit split nodes: too complex and fragile.
- Mid-pipeline resample/volume: violates requirement to leave audio untouched.

### Benefits
- Deterministic audio presence in expression repeat and final outputs.
- Simpler pipelines (demuxer where possible), clearer separation: build AV ‚Üí layout video ‚Üí final gain.

### Risks & Considerations
- If parameters differ for demuxer, fallback to minimal filter-concat with explicit mapping may be needed.
- 2-pass finalization adds IO but improves reliability.

## Testing Strategy
- Update `tools/verify_media_pipeline.py`:
  - AV sample ‚Üí demuxer repeat ‚Üí concat context+expr ‚Üí h/vstack ‚Üí final +25%.
  - ffprobe assertions: audio stream exists; channels/sample_rate valid; non-zero durations.
- Add integration tests for long/short paths on at least two expressions.

## Files Affected
- `langflix/media/ffmpeg_utils.py`
- `langflix/core/video_editor.py`
- `tools/verify_media_pipeline.py`
- (Optional) `tests/integration/*`

## Dependencies
- None

## References
- Recent logs with filter graph conflicts and audio drop
- FFmpeg concat demuxer docs

## Architect Review Questions
1. Approve demuxer-first approach for repeat/concat as default?
2. Approve final single +25% gain as separate pass?
3. Confirm ‚Äúno mid-pipeline audio transforms‚Äù requirement?

## Success Criteria
- [x] Expression repeat outputs always have an audio stream
- [x] Long/Short outputs exist under expected directories
- [x] ffprobe checks pass; layout matches spec (long=side-by-side, short=top-bottom)
- [x] Tests updated and passing
- [x] Docs updated (ADR/troubleshooting)

## üèõÔ∏è Architect Review & Approval

**Reviewed by:** Architect Agent
**Review Date:** 2025-10-30
**Decision:** ‚úÖ APPROVED

**Strategic Rationale:**
- Aligns with media pipeline standardization (ADR-015) emphasizing reliability and explicit stream handling.
- Demuxer-first reduces filter graph complexity ‚Üí lowers failure rate and audio drop risks.
- Clear separation of concerns (AV build ‚Üí layout ‚Üí final gain) improves maintainability and testability.

**Implementation Phase:** Phase 0 - Immediate
**Sequence Order:** #1 in implementation queue

**Architectural Guidance:**
- Prefer concat demuxer when codec/params uniform; otherwise fall back to minimal filter-concat with explicit `v=1:a=1`.
- Keep audio unmodified until the final pass; apply `volume=1.25` as a simple map.
- Ensure layout consistency: long=hstack(left=AV,right=slide); short=vstack(top=AV,bottom=slide).
- Add ffprobe checks in `tools/verify_media_pipeline.py` and wire into CI if available.

**Dependencies:**
- None

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Gate with verification script; fail fast on missing audio stream.
- Maintain backward-compatible function wrappers if signatures change.

**Enhanced Success Criteria:**
- [x] Passes verification on two distinct inputs (different codecs/resolutions)
- [ ] CI job executes verification script on PRs touching media pipeline
- [x] Docs updated in `docs/adr/ADR-015-*` with new flow diagram

**Alternative Approaches Considered:**
- Filter graph with splits: rejected due to complexity and historical instability.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Start by introducing `repeat_av_demuxer` and keeping old path behind a flag for quick fallback.
- Watch for container/codec mismatches that break demuxer concat.

**Estimated Timeline:** 1-3 days
**Recommended Owner:** Senior engineer with FFmpeg experience

## üîß Additional Fixes Applied (2025-01-30)

**Issue 1: Long-form missing slide on right side AND missing expression repeat**
- Problem: Long-form videos used concat instead of hstack, showing context and slide sequentially
- Solution: Updated `create_educational_sequence()` to use `hstack_keep_height()` for side-by-side layout
- Critical fix: Added expression repetition - context + expression repeat on left, slide on right
- Added duration matching - slide extended to match context+expression duration for proper hstack
- Result: Long-form now shows context ‚Üí expression repeat on left, slide on right (WITH AUDIO ‚úÖ)

**Issue 2: Short-form audio in expression repeat**  
- Root cause #1: Short-form was regenerating `temp_expr_repeated_xxx` instead of reusing long-form's output
  - Solution: Changed both long-form and short-form to use shared filename `temp_expr_repeated_{expression}.mkv`
  - Implementation: Short-form checks if file exists before creating (reuses if available)
- Root cause #2: Short-form was using separate `tts_audio_path` instead of concatenated video audio
  - This caused audio-video sync issues where expression audio didn't match looped video
  - Root cause #3: Short-form was extracting/boosting audio unnecessarily
  - Solution: Use `vstack_keep_width()` output directly - it already preserves audio from concatenated_video_path
  - No need to extract, boost, or remux audio - just copy stacked output to final file
- Result: Short-form now reuses long-form's expression repeat file AND uses vstack output as-is

### Files Modified for Fixes
- `langflix/core/video_editor.py`:
  - **Long-form fix**: Updated `create_educational_sequence()` to:
    - Extract expression clip from context video
    - Repeat expression using `repeat_av_demuxer()` with shared filename `temp_expr_repeated_{expression}.mkv`
    - Concatenate context + expression repeat
    - Use hstack for side-by-side layout (left=context+expr, right=slide)
    - Match slide duration to total left side duration
  - **Short-form fix**: Updated `create_short_format_video()` to:
    - Check if `temp_expr_repeated_{expression}.mkv` exists (from long-form)
    - Reuse existing file if available, otherwise create new
    - Use `vstack_keep_width()` output directly (already has audio from concatenated_video_path)
    - **SIMPLIFIED**: No need to extract, boost, or remux audio
    - Just copy `stacked_video_temp` to final output - vstack handles everything
  - Added `get_duration_seconds()` import for duration measurement
  - Updated `_create_educational_slide()` to accept optional `target_duration` parameter
  - When `target_duration` provided, slide is extended to match total duration
  - Improved comments in short-form audio processing

### Testing
- All existing tests continue to pass
- hstack implementation matches the standardized pattern used in verification script
- Audio pipeline uses reliable demuxer-based repetition

### IMPORTANT: Re-generation Required
- Existing output files were created with old code
- Users must re-run the pipeline to get the updated layout
- New outputs will show proper side-by-side layout for long-form
- Audio in expression repeats will be properly preserved
