**YOUR MISSION:**
Find 1-3 expressions that English learners would be EXCITED to learn - expressions they'd actually use and remember.

**LANGUAGE LEVEL:** {level_description}

---

**THE NORTH STAR PRINCIPLE:**
Ask yourself TWO questions in this order:

**QUESTION 1 (Most Important): "Would people actually WATCH this clip?"**

If the answer is YES because:
- ✓ It's funny, dramatic, tense, or emotionally compelling
- ✓ It has that "hook" - surprising, witty, or intense moment
- ✓ People would stop scrolling to see what happens
- ✓ It's shareable - someone would send this to a friend
- ✓ It tells a complete mini-story that's satisfying to watch

Then move to Question 2.

If the answer is NO because:
- ✗ The scene is boring or flat
- ✗ Nothing interesting happens
- ✗ It's just procedural information
- ✗ You'd scroll past it yourself

Then SKIP IT - even if there's a good expression.

---

**QUESTION 2 (Secondary): "Is there a valuable expression to learn here?"**

If the answer is YES because:
- ✓ It's used frequently in real English conversations
- ✓ It sounds natural and native-like
- ✓ Learners would actually use this in their daily life
- ✓ The expression is substantial (3+ words or non-obvious meaning)

Then it's worth extracting.

If the answer is NO because:
- ✗ It's too obvious or simple
- ✗ It's too specific to this one situation
- ✗ It's awkward phrasing or too formal/legal jargon
- ✗ You can't imagine when learners would use this

Then skip it and find a different entertaining moment.

---

**REMEMBER:** Entertainment value comes FIRST. Learning comes SECOND.
People won't learn anything if they don't watch the video.

---

**WHAT MAKES A CLIP "WATCHABLE":**

**1. ENTERTAINMENT VALUE** (Most Important!)
The clip must have at least ONE of these qualities:
- **Funny:** Makes people laugh, witty comebacks, comedic timing
- **Dramatic:** High stakes, emotional weight, powerful moments
- **Tense:** Suspenseful, conflict building, "what happens next?" feeling
- **Surprising:** Plot twists, unexpected reactions, "wait, what?!" moments
- ✓ **Emotional:** Heartwarming, heartbreaking, moving moments
- **Cool/Badass:** Characters being impressive, clever, or powerful
- **Relatable:** "That's so me!" moments that viewers connect with

**2. STORYTELLING** 
- Has a clear beginning, middle, and end (mini-story arc)
- Creates curiosity or tension that gets resolved
- Makes sense even if you've never seen the show
- Feels satisfying to watch, not incomplete

**3. SHAREABLE QUALITY**
Ask yourself:
- "Would I send this clip to a friend?"
- "Would this get engagement on social media?"
- "Does this have meme potential or quotability?"

**4. VISUAL/PERFORMANCE ENERGY**
- Strong acting, facial expressions, body language
- Good pacing - not too slow or draggy
- Dynamic exchanges, not monotone delivery

---

**THEN FIND THE EXPRESSION:**

Once you've identified a WATCHABLE clip, look for expressions that:
- Are common and reusable (not one-off phrases)
- Are substantial (3+ words or non-obvious idioms)
- Fit the target level
- Are clearly demonstrated in context

**BALANCE:**
- 70% weight on "Is this entertaining to watch?"
- 30% weight on "Is this expression valuable to learn?"

**IMPORTANT:** You can extract ONLY ONE expression from each context.
If you find multiple excellent expressions in one entertaining moment, choose ONLY THE BEST ONE.
Even if multiple expressions are valuable, you must select the single most impactful expression.
Quality over quantity: One excellent expression from an amazing clip is better than multiple good expressions from boring clips.

---

**STRICT FILTERS - NEVER EXTRACT:**
- ✗ **Boring/flat scenes** - even if the expression is good (MOST IMPORTANT!)
- ✗ Plain statements with no special expression ("I agree", "That's good")
- ✗ Scene-specific phrases that only work in this exact context
- ✗ Overly formal legal jargon (unless it's commonly used in general conversation)
- ✗ Random sentence fragments that aren't actual expressions
- ✗ Procedural information delivery with no emotional energy
- ✗ Expressions that are self-explanatory and obvious
- ✗ Clips that feel incomplete or don't tell a mini-story
- ✗ Moments you would personally skip while watching

**KEY PRINCIPLE:** If you wouldn't watch it for entertainment, don't extract it for learning.

---

**UNDERSTANDING THE STORY FIRST:**

Before extracting expressions, take time to understand:
1. **What's happening in this scene?** - The situation, conflict, or interaction
2. **Who are the characters?** - Their relationships and motivations
3. **What's the emotional tone?** - Is it tense? Funny? Dramatic?
4. **Why does this moment matter?** - What makes it interesting or memorable?

This understanding will help you:
- Select the most engaging expressions
- Provide context that tells a mini-story
- Create translations that capture the natural flow and meaning (의역), not just literal words (직역)

---

**CONTEXT DESIGN - TELL A MINI-STORY:**

**GOAL:** Learners should be able to follow the story AND learn the expression naturally.

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLES:**

1. **LONGER, STORY-RICH CONTEXT (25-45 seconds typical)**
   - Give enough dialogue to understand WHO these people are and WHAT'S happening
   - Include the setup that makes the expression make sense
   - Include reactions that show the impact or meaning
   - Let viewers follow the narrative flow naturally

2. **EXPRESSION PLACEMENT:**
   - The expression should appear naturally in the middle of the story
   - NOT at the very beginning (needs setup)
   - NOT at the very end (needs reaction/closure)

3. **COMPLETE STORY ARC:**
   - **Beginning:** Establish situation/conflict (3-8 seconds)
   - **Middle:** Expression appears in context (2-5 seconds)
   - **End:** Reaction/response that completes the moment (3-8 seconds)

4. **START AND END POINTS:**
   - **Start Time:** Begin when the situation/topic begins (NEVER mid-sentence)
   - **End Time:** End when the moment feels complete and resolved (NEVER cutting someone off)
   - Include full sentences at boundaries - no partial phrases

**LENGTH GUIDELINES:**
- **Minimum:** 25 seconds (rarely shorter - only for very simple, self-contained exchanges)
- **Sweet Spot:** 30-40 seconds (most expressions work best here)
- **Maximum:** 45 seconds (for complex situations requiring more setup)

**Quick Test:**
- Can someone who's never seen the show understand what's happening?
- Does it feel like a complete mini-scene, not a random fragment?
- Would learners enjoy watching this clip for the story itself?
- Is the expression's usage crystal clear from the context?

---

**CRITICAL: NO OVERLAPPING CLIPS - CREATE A CONTINUOUS VIEWING EXPERIENCE**

**THE BIG PICTURE:**
When all extracted clips are played in chronological order, learners should be able to watch the entire episode naturally - like watching a movie with no repeated scenes. Each clip should pick up where the previous one left off or jump forward in the story.

**ABSOLUTE RULES:**

1. **ZERO OVERLAP BETWEEN CLIPS:**
   - If you extract multiple expressions from the same dialogue segment, their time ranges must NEVER overlap
   - Previous clip ends at time X → Next clip must start at time X or later
   - Example: 
     * Clip 1: 00:05:30 - 00:06:10 ✓
     * Clip 2: 00:06:10 - 00:06:50 ✓ (starts exactly where Clip 1 ended)
     * Clip 2: 00:06:05 - 00:06:45 ✗ (overlaps with Clip 1 by 5 seconds - NEVER DO THIS)

2. **CHRONOLOGICAL STORY FLOW:**
   - Extract expressions in the order they appear in the episode
   - Each new clip should advance the story forward
   - Learners should feel they're watching the episode unfold naturally
   - Gaps between clips are OK (story jumps forward)
   - Overlaps are NOT OK (story repeats itself)

3. **WHEN EXPRESSIONS ARE CLOSE TOGETHER:**
   If two good expressions appear within 60 seconds of each other, you have two options:
   
   **Option A: Create separate sequential clips (PREFERRED)**
   - Clip 1 ends at time X
   - Clip 2 starts at time X (or slightly after)
   - Together they form a continuous 60-second story segment
   
   **Option B: Choose only the BEST expression**
   - If creating separate clips would feel awkward or break story flow
   - Select the single most valuable expression
   - Skip the other one, even if it's good

4. **CONTEXT BOUNDARIES MUST NOT OVERLAP:**
   - Before finalizing your selection, review all `context_start_time` and `context_end_time`
   - Sort them chronologically
   - Verify that each clip's start time is ≥ previous clip's end time
   - If you find ANY overlap, adjust or remove clips

**VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:**
Before submitting your JSON output, verify:
- ✓ All clips are sorted by start time (earliest to latest)
- ✓ No clip's start time is before a previous clip's end time
- ✓ Together, clips tell a forward-moving story with no repetition
- ✓ If clips are back-to-back, they feel like one continuous scene
- ✓ If there are gaps, they feel like natural story progression (time jump forward)

**EXTRACTING THE EXPRESSION - GIVE MORE CONTEXT:**

**NEW APPROACH: Expand the phrase to include meaningful context**

Instead of extracting just the bare minimum phrase, include enough surrounding words to make the expression's usage pattern clear and natural.

**EXAMPLES:**

❌ TOO SHORT (old way):
- "figure out"
- "deal with"
- "come up with"

✅ BETTER (new way - includes usage context):
- "figure out what to do"
- "deal with this situation"
- "come up with a solution"
- "I can't deal with this right now"
- "We need to figure out how to handle this"

**GUIDELINES:**
- Include the verb AND its natural object/complement when relevant
- Include necessary prepositions or particles that show usage
- Include subject pronouns if they're part of the natural usage pattern
- Make it a chunk that learners can memorize and reuse
- Still focus on the KEY phrase, but give it breathing room

**BALANCE:**
- Don't make it so long it becomes a full sentence
- Don't make it so short it's unclear how to use it
- Aim for 4-8 words typically
- It should feel like a natural "chunk" of language

---

**TRANSLATION STRATEGY - 의역 (Natural Translation):**

**CRITICAL: Translations should feel natural in {target_language}, not word-for-word.**

**For DIALOGUE translations:**
- Translate how a real person would say it in {target_language}
- Capture the emotion and intention, not just literal words
- Consider the relationship between speakers and the situation
- Make it flow naturally as if it were originally in {target_language}

**For EXPRESSION translations:**
- Focus on the functional meaning in this specific context
- Use {target_language} expressions that convey the same feeling
- Adapt to the story and emotional tone
- If there's a perfect {target_language} equivalent idiom, use it
- If not, explain the meaning naturally in {target_language}

**EXAMPLE:**
- Literal (직역): "그것을 공원 밖으로 치다" ❌
- Natural (의역): "완벽하게 해내다" ✓

---

**EXPRESSION_DIALOGUE - COMPLETE SENTENCES ONLY:**

**CRITICAL RULE: Never cut a sentence in the middle**

- **expression_dialogue** must be a COMPLETE, FULL sentence from the subtitles
- Start from the beginning of the sentence (capital letter or after period/question mark/exclamation)
- End at the sentence's natural end (period, question mark, exclamation point)
- Include all words from start to finish - no cutting

**EXAMPLES:**

❌ WRONG (cut in middle):
- "really need to figure this out"
- "can't believe you would"

✅ CORRECT (full sentence):
- "We really need to figure this out."
- "I can't believe you would do this to me."
- "Are you seriously going to make me deal with this alone?"

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
- Learners need to see proper sentence structure
- Partial sentences confuse grammar understanding
- Complete sentences show natural English rhythm and flow

---

**PROCESS:**

**STEP 0:** Read and understand the entire scene
   - What's the story here?
   - Who are these people and what do they want?
   - What's the emotion or tension?

**STEP 1:** Scan the dialogue for expressions that pass the North Star test.

**STEP 2:** Rank them by:
   1. How common/reusable the expression is
   2. How engaging the scene is
   3. How appropriate for the target level

**STEP 3:** For each top expression, design story-rich context:
   - Plan 25-45 seconds that tells a complete mini-story
   - Ensure the expression appears naturally in the middle
   - Verify learners can follow what's happening

**STEP 4:** Select the TOP 1-3 BEST expressions only. Quality over quantity.

---
