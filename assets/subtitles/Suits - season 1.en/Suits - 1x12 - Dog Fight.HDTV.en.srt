00:00:05,661 --> 00:00:07,679
But the least you could do
is be honest with Jenny.

That's what
this is all about?

you started dating her.

concerned, we're done.

But you can't
tell anyone, ever.

This guy is not your friend.
He is an anchor.

He is my oldest friend.

What would you do?

He was 18.

going to do?

What's that?

162
00:06:11,148 --> 00:06:12,675
It's an article where
Clifford Danner took his plea.

163
00:06:12,676 --> 00:06:14,046
- Do you want me to read it to you?
- No.

164
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:16,532
"Clifford Danner
had a history of violence.

165
00:06:16,635 --> 00:06:17,969
"This poor girl
was brutally murdered

166
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,238
"at a high-end,
private school and, quote,

167
00:06:20,272 --> 00:06:22,240
"'this doesn't
sound like the work

168
00:06:22,275 --> 00:06:23,842
"of the squash team captain
to me.'"

169
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:25,210
I don't know, Harvey,
this article makes

170
00:06:25,244 --> 00:06:27,046
a pretty compelling case
that he's guilty.

171
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,981
Well, he's not.

172
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:30,916
- It's quoting you.
- I was wrong.

173
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,017
Jessica,
I don't think you should

174
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:33,652
let Harvey take this case.

175
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:35,988
Louis, we're talking
about a man's life.

176
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:37,623
And if Harvey thinks
the kid didn't do it,

177
00:06:37,657 --> 00:06:38,623
then so do I.

178
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:39,624
I understand that,

179
00:06:39,658 --> 00:06:40,692
but what Harvey thinks

180
00:06:40,726 --> 00:06:41,693
and what Harvey can prove

181
00:06:41,727 --> 00:06:43,094
are two different things.

182
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:45,430
In my experience
with Harvey,

183
00:06:45,464 --> 00:06:46,965
it's one and the same.

184
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:48,299
Listen to me--
he was set up.

185
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:50,601
Jill Hodgkins
went to him and said

186
00:06:50,636 --> 00:06:52,036
that she was gonna turn in
these two other guys

187
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:53,104
for selling coke.

188
00:06:53,138 --> 00:06:54,672
They killed her
and planted the coke

189
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,107
in Clifford's room.

190
00:06:56,141 --> 00:06:58,409
I didn't buy his story
because his DNA was on her.

191
00:06:58,444 --> 00:06:59,844
He claimed that it
was because they were

192
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,246
having this
secret relationship.

193
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,881
But he had no proof.

194
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:04,749
And now he does.

195
00:07:04,783 --> 00:07:06,217
Okay, I hate
to disagree with you here,

196
00:07:06,252 --> 00:07:08,253
but I took a little poll
of the partners--

197
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,621
Whoa. You did what?

198
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:10,755
Well, I was discreet,
I assure you.

199
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:12,324
And they feel, as I do,

200
00:07:12,358 --> 00:07:14,359
that Harvey's actions
will hurt this firm.

201
00:07:14,394 --> 00:07:16,061
This firm?

202
00:07:16,095 --> 00:07:17,395
You mean my firm.

203
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:18,563
And when you're
running the firm

204
00:07:18,597 --> 00:07:20,398
of Litt, nothing,
and nobody,

205
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:22,434
then you can make
whatever call you'd like.

206
00:07:22,468 --> 00:07:24,235
Until then,

207
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,071
you can just
get back to work.

208
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:27,805
I'm telling you,
those guys did it.

209
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,308
And as far as his violent
history is concerned,

210
00:07:30,342 --> 00:07:31,776
you of all people
are gonna tell me

211
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,145
that a person can't change
if they get a second chance?

212
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:35,913
What do you need me to do?

213
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:45,990
Hey.

214
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:47,458
I need your help.

215
00:07:47,493 --> 00:07:48,727
I thought I made it clear
that I don't expect

216
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:50,195
to hear those words
from your mouth ever again.

217
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:52,064
- It's important.
- It's always important.

218
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:53,298
- It's for Harvey.
- It's always for Harvey.

219
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,334
He specifically
asked for you.

220
00:07:55,369 --> 00:07:56,502
By name?

221
00:07:56,537 --> 00:07:57,804
He said he wanted the best.

222
00:07:57,838 --> 00:07:59,506
Well, if he didn't
specifically name me,

223
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,341
and you didn't specifically
tell him,

224
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,976
then I am going to
specifically decline.

225
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:05,644
[Sighs]

226
00:08:05,678 --> 00:08:06,844
Rachel.

227
00:08:08,013 --> 00:08:09,213
Are you kidding me?

228
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:11,783
Okay.

229
00:08:11,817 --> 00:08:13,351
I know that you're
mad at me.

230
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:15,519
But we're talking about a guy
roughly our age

231
00:08:15,553 --> 00:08:16,920
who spent over a decade
in prison

232
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,255
for a murder
that he didn't commit,

233
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,857
and we are trying
to get him out.

234
00:08:21,426 --> 00:08:23,594
I think that's more important
than our little...

235
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,630
whatever.

236
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:26,631
Whatever?

237
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:27,799
You know what I mean.

238
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,335
Problems with two people.
Hill of beans.

239
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,504
I don't know what
you're talking about.

240
00:08:31,538 --> 00:08:32,705
<i>Casablanca.</i>

241
00:08:32,739 --> 00:08:34,173
Oh, I've never
seen that movie.

242
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,810
- You--
- No, it's--it's old.

243
00:08:36,844 --> 00:08:38,011
Old?

244
00:08:38,046 --> 00:08:39,413
Oh, my God.

245
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:41,449
Okay, what's your basis
for getting him out?

246
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:43,551
- Prosecutorial misconduct?
- Buried evidence.

247
00:08:43,586 --> 00:08:45,953
Okay, then you need
precedence to overturn.

248
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:48,156
- I already got those.
- Then what?

249
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,557
I need to find out
everything I can

250
00:08:49,592 --> 00:08:51,826
about the former D.A.'s cases.

251
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,328
[Sighs]

252
00:08:56,463 --> 00:08:57,630
Okay.

253
00:08:57,664 --> 00:08:59,365
<i>Gone With The Wind?</i>

254
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,400
- No.
- <i>Citizen Kane?</i>

255
00:09:00,434 --> 00:09:02,135
- No.
- <i>Dirty Dancing?</i>

256
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:03,436
Nobody puts Baby
in the corner.

257
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,471
- I can't believe you.
- I'm helping you.

258
00:09:05,506 --> 00:09:06,739
- Let's go.
- Ah...

259
00:09:06,774 --> 00:09:08,575
You thought to do this
on your own?

260
00:09:08,609 --> 00:09:10,443
I decided
to think like you.

261
00:09:10,477 --> 00:09:11,844
This is a high-profile
murder case

262
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,913
against the new district
attorney himself.

263
00:09:13,948 --> 00:09:15,515
- You know that, right?
- I know.

264
00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:16,849
And you think I'm gonna
let you come with me

265
00:09:16,884 --> 00:09:19,185
for this, don't you?
I know you are.

266
00:09:19,219 --> 00:09:20,786
You known, I don't want you
thinking like me and--

267
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:22,054
Now you know how
the rest of us feel.

268
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:23,756
- Aha, right there.
- I always would have said that.

269
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,990
- You wouldn't.
- Yes, I would.

270
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:30,896
Harvey Specter.

271
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,264
Terrance Wolf.
That's your case?

272
00:09:33,298 --> 00:09:35,466
I thought it best
to cut a deal,

273
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,201
let him out for time served.

274
00:09:37,235 --> 00:09:40,204
Hm, high profile murder
at a prep school.

275
00:09:40,238 --> 00:09:42,839
No, I don't think I'll
be cutting any deals.

276
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,908
Miguel Ruiz,
Lawrence Baker,

277
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:46,744
Ray Jenkins,
Calvin Reynolds.

278
00:09:46,778 --> 00:09:48,346
And who are
these gentlemen?

279
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,749
They're other cases
with improprieties

280
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:53,886
that we'll be forced to cite
if we have to file to reopen.

281
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,921
You, of all people,
don't want that.

282
00:09:55,956 --> 00:09:58,057
Really? Why not?

283
00:09:58,092 --> 00:09:59,426
Because it'll
make you look bad.

284
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,595
Didn't happen on my watch.

285
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:03,530
You're supposed to be
cleaning up the office.

286
00:10:03,565 --> 00:10:05,699
I find sunshine is the best
disinfectant.

287
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:07,234
Your mother teach you that?

288
00:10:07,268 --> 00:10:08,669
No, Harvey,
life taught me that.

289
00:10:08,703 --> 00:10:10,171
This man's innocent.

290
00:10:10,205 --> 00:10:11,472
Then he should have
gone to trial.

291
00:10:11,507 --> 00:10:12,640
Evidence was buried.

292
00:10:12,674 --> 00:10:14,275
Then dig it up.

293
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:16,277
And make your case.

294
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:19,180
Mike...give me a minute.

295
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:23,584
Terrance, you're
forcing me to do something

296
00:10:23,618 --> 00:10:24,952
that I'd rather not do.

297
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:26,720
- And what is that?
- Take this case on.

298
00:10:26,754 --> 00:10:27,754
I win.

299
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:29,156
It's what I do.

300
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,059
It'll send a message
around your entire office.

301
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:33,760
That you can't
handle your business.

302
00:10:33,795 --> 00:10:34,795
Well, if I lose, I lose.

303
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:37,598
That's the way
the law works.

304
00:10:37,632 --> 00:10:38,766
But, Harvey, don't think

305
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,601
I can't send a message
or two myself.

306
00:10:40,635 --> 00:10:42,336
Rumor has
it you're the traitor

307
00:10:42,371 --> 00:10:44,171
who sold out
his former boss.

308
00:10:44,206 --> 00:10:45,339
It wasn't me.

309
00:10:45,374 --> 00:10:46,574
Those rumors are wrong.

310
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:49,377
So mysterious evidence

311
00:10:49,412 --> 00:10:51,279
from back in the day
on your old boss

312
00:10:51,313 --> 00:10:53,615
just appeared?

313
00:10:56,285 --> 00:10:57,919
You didn't know.

314
00:10:57,954 --> 00:11:00,422
It wasn't you.

315
00:11:00,456 --> 00:11:03,391
But it had to be somebody,
right, Harvey?

316
00:11:03,425 --> 00:11:05,160
Have a nice day.

317
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:11,366
My office--now.

318
00:11:14,903 --> 00:11:18,139
I have never thought about
firing you.

319
00:11:18,174 --> 00:11:20,608
You took something
when we quit the D.A.'s office?

320
00:11:20,642 --> 00:11:22,077
Come clean right now,
or I'll let you go

321
00:11:22,111 --> 00:11:23,378
and not give it
a minute's thought.

322
00:11:23,412 --> 00:11:24,479
[Sighs]

323
00:11:24,513 --> 00:11:26,147
I knew it.

324
00:11:26,182 --> 00:11:28,350
You were in trouble.

325
00:11:28,384 --> 00:11:30,419
You had no right.

326
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:33,122
I don't care.

327
00:11:33,156 --> 00:11:34,824
What'd you do with it?

328
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:36,326
She did
what she had to do.

329
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,327
She gave it to me.

330
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:38,362
And the two of you saw fit

331
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:39,830
to fight my battles for me?

332
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:43,067
We did what you would have
done for either one of us.

333
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:44,668
So get off your high horse.

334
00:11:44,702 --> 00:11:46,704
Leave the woman alone.

335
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:52,343
We work because I've always
known that I can trust you.

336
00:11:52,377 --> 00:11:54,645
Don't ever go behind
my back again.

337
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:57,881
You're welcome.

338
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,962
Wait, he called you?

339
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:13,999
Yeah.
He left a message.

340
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:17,135
What did he say?

341
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,603
[Sighs]
That...

342
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,138
he wanted to see me.

343
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:22,040
And what did you do?

344
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,576
Texted him and I told him
I wasn't interested.

345
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,314
Uh...we gotta tell him.

346
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,449
No, we don't.

347
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,583
Yeah, we do.

348
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,351
I'm already
living a lie at work.

349
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,053
I-I can't live one
at home too.

350
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,755
Do you think that if you
told Trevor about us

351
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,256
he's gonna keep
your secret to himself?

352
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,424
I know Trevor.

353
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,092
If I tell him,
he will take it up with me.

354
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,260
If he hears it
from someone else--

355
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,028
- Who's gonna tell him?
- I don't know!

356
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,164
Okay? I just--I know
that he's over there right now,

357
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:49,233
and it's drilling a hole
in my brain.

358
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:50,868
Then stay here.

359
00:12:50,902 --> 00:12:52,769
- I can't.
- Why not?

360
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:54,305
Because he came to me
for help.

361
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:00,978
Okay.

362
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:05,082
Okay what?

363
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:06,683
Tell him.

364
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:09,186
But please wait until
he has his life back together.

365
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,588
What do you mean?

366
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:11,822
He came to you for help.

367
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:14,058
How much help do you think
hearing about us

368
00:13:14,092 --> 00:13:15,526
is gonna be for him?

369
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,763
Okay.

370
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:19,764
Okay what?

371
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,599
Okay, I'll stay.

372
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:26,070
Could you just not
touch anything?

373
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,672
Because, uh...

374
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,574
I like my place just so.

375
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,077
What?
This place is a mess.

376
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,245
What are you...

377
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,280
[Both laugh]

378
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:42,587
The court finds
sufficient misconduct

379
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,089
to warrant a new trial.

380
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,591
Any pretrial motions
at this time?

381
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,093
Yes, Your Honor.

382
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:49,494
The state advises
that we will be seeking

383
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,329
the maximum sentence
of life in prison.

384
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:52,497
What?

385
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,632
Your Honor, my client
has four years left.

386
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,434
Mr. Specter,
the state has every right

387
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,834
to seek that penalty.

388
00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:00,003
Would you like to confer
with your client

389
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:02,305
before I vacate
his conviction?

390
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,541
You could just withdraw
your motion right now.

391
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:06,610
I'll confer with my client,
Your Honor.

392
00:14:11,215 --> 00:14:13,250
Get the message?

393
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:19,824
Four more years.

394
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:22,594
Or you get out now.

395
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:26,864
Or stay in
the rest of my life.

396
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,834
September 19, 2007.

397
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,368
What?

398
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,104
His halfway point.

399
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,574
Day I realized
I could make it.

400
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:39,878
You never said
this could happen.

401
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:40,879
He's sending a message.

402
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,080
It's got nothing
to do with you.

403
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,515
It's got everything
to do with me.

404
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,516
What do you wanna do?

405
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,318
What do you think?

406
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,521
If we win, I want in.
If we lose, I don't.

407
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,322
We'll win.

408
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:52,457
How do you know?

409
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,725
Because I know.

410
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,193
Same way you knew
I was guilty?

411
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,464
What do you think?

412
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,866
I think Harvey
wins his cases.

413
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,134
What would you do?

414
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:06,304
I'd trust him.

415
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:11,242
Harvey, can you
give us a minute?

416
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,052
[Door shuts]

417
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:25,723
Clifford...

418
00:15:25,757 --> 00:15:28,292
I don't you,
and you don't know me.

419
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:33,397
But I'm gonna tell you a story
about what that man did for me.

420
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:35,433
And why I think
you should trust him.

421
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:47,509
Mr. Specter...

422
00:15:47,544 --> 00:15:49,111
Gonna withdraw your motion?

423
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:51,946
Your Honor, my client
wishes to proceed to trial.

424
00:16:05,075 --> 00:16:07,656
Gensync Chemical.

425
00:16:07,657 --> 00:16:08,724
You dropped this today.

426
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:10,093
Louis's client?

427
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:13,230
Louis's Fortune 500 client.
You wanna guess why?

428
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,499
His ears?
They freak a lot of people out.

429
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:17,234
That was one client.

430
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,370
His teeth?
Fidgeting?

431
00:16:19,404 --> 00:16:20,404
Could be anything.

432
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,405
All right, stop it.

433
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,640
Let me guess:
One of the board members

434
00:16:22,674 --> 00:16:23,907
has a kid
who went to his school.

435
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:24,975
A daughter.

436
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,011
And Lou's correctly
pointed out

437
00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:28,646
that they might not be
the only clients

438
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,180
that will punish us
for taking this case.

439
00:16:30,214 --> 00:16:31,648
- Which costs us money.
- Mm-hmm.

440
00:16:31,683 --> 00:16:33,384
Louis is in the majority
this time.

441
00:16:33,418 --> 00:16:36,253
Which hurts your position
with the partners.

442
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:37,555
You telling me to crop this?

443
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:40,625
I'm telling you to win.

444
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:42,026
But that's not why
I called you in here.

445
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,695
Have a seat.

446
00:16:49,502 --> 00:16:50,735
Donna.

447
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,370
Mm-hmm.

448
00:16:52,405 --> 00:16:53,605
You need to get over it.

449
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,607
I'm trying.
It's not that easy.

450
00:16:55,642 --> 00:16:56,609
Yes, it is.

451
00:16:56,643 --> 00:16:57,777
Tell me.

452
00:16:57,811 --> 00:17:00,413
Okay.

453
00:17:00,448 --> 00:17:02,382
Think about what your life
would be like without her.

454
00:17:07,422 --> 00:17:08,556
Now I know.

455
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,690
Know what?

456
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:11,559
How you always forgive me.

457
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:14,195
Oh, it's nowhere near
as easy to forgive you.

458
00:17:14,229 --> 00:17:16,064
Thank about it.

459
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:17,899
Oh, I do.

460
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:20,001
Every goddamn day.

461
00:17:31,146 --> 00:17:32,446
Hey.

462
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,814
Hey.

463
00:17:33,848 --> 00:17:35,115
We're starting trial today.

464
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,950
I know,
you've got five minutes.

465
00:17:36,984 --> 00:17:39,052
Never start a trial
without doing our thing.

466
00:17:39,086 --> 00:17:40,953
Yeah, well,
you don't have time.

467
00:17:40,988 --> 00:17:42,288
There's plenty of time.

468
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:44,356
You don't have <i>time.</i>

469
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:50,228
I'm sorry.

470
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:56,968
For what?

471
00:17:57,002 --> 00:17:59,170
Don't push it.

472
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:00,938
Okay, let's go.
You got three minutes.

473
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:02,673
Okay, here or in my office?

474
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,142
- Here's good.
- Okay, on three.

475
00:18:04,176 --> 00:18:05,276
One, two--

476
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:06,478
Wait, let's go
in your office.

477
00:18:06,512 --> 00:18:07,946
- I'll get the can opener.
- Yeah.

478
00:18:12,618 --> 00:18:14,185
You left that
in the kitchen.

479
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,087
Thanks.
I hate it when I do that.

480
00:18:16,122 --> 00:18:17,489
You don't have any numbers
in your speed dial.

481
00:18:17,523 --> 00:18:18,790
I don't need 'em.

482
00:18:18,824 --> 00:18:20,859
And yet you
forgot your phone.

483
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:22,327
It's not the same thing.

484
00:18:22,361 --> 00:18:23,328
Okay.

485
00:18:23,362 --> 00:18:24,896
Hey, Rachel...

486
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,331
Um...

487
00:18:26,365 --> 00:18:28,033
thank you for before.

488
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:29,467
Sure.

489
00:18:29,502 --> 00:18:31,002
I mean...

490
00:18:31,036 --> 00:18:32,871
it was for Harvey.

491
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:34,506
Yes.

492
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,874
Hmm.
[Phone ringing]

493
00:18:42,514 --> 00:18:43,515
Hey.

494
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:46,485
Today's your first trial.

495
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:48,387
What? I've been
to trial before.

496
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:50,022
Yeah, but not when
you've been with me.

497
00:18:50,056 --> 00:18:52,291
Fair enough.

498
00:18:52,326 --> 00:18:54,560
Okay, I wanna start
a ritual with you.

499
00:18:54,594 --> 00:18:55,561
What do you wanna do?

500
00:18:55,595 --> 00:18:57,396
We're on the...

501
00:18:57,431 --> 00:18:58,397
phone.

502
00:18:58,432 --> 00:18:59,866
Remember that gymnastics video

503
00:18:59,901 --> 00:19:01,534
we saw?

504
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:03,970
Yeah, I can
get behind that.

505
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,408
- Feeling good?
- Never better.

506
00:19:08,443 --> 00:19:11,611
- You?
- I'm ready to roll.

507
00:19:11,646 --> 00:19:13,346
Don't think I didn't
see that can opener.

508
00:19:22,255 --> 00:19:24,223
What do you think you're doing
by opening this case?

509
00:19:24,257 --> 00:19:25,824
I'm making sure
an innocent man

510
00:19:25,858 --> 00:19:27,859
doesn't suffer
for the crimes of others.

511
00:19:27,893 --> 00:19:29,160
And what about Jill?

512
00:19:29,195 --> 00:19:31,029
Don't you care
how she suffered?

513
00:19:31,063 --> 00:19:33,331
You two would know more
about that than anyone, right?

514
00:19:33,366 --> 00:19:34,399
Excuse me.

515
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:36,101
I bought the devastated friend
act

516
00:19:36,135 --> 00:19:37,502
12 years ago.

517
00:19:37,537 --> 00:19:38,804
But I know better now.

518
00:19:38,838 --> 00:19:41,607
Mike, meet Jason Black
and Matt Bailey.

519
00:19:41,642 --> 00:19:43,242
Just don't
shake their hands.

520
00:19:43,276 --> 00:19:45,410
They've got Jill Hodgkins' blood
all over them.

521
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:46,878
Look, I don't know
what you think you know.

522
00:19:46,913 --> 00:19:48,980
But when I'm done testifying,
the jury's gonna know

523
00:19:49,014 --> 00:19:51,315
that Clifford killed Jill.

524
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,517
Just 'cause
you switched sides,

525
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:54,419
doesn't mean the rest
of the world did.

526
00:19:58,324 --> 00:20:01,226
- We just lost the letter.
- The what?

527
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,261
I didn't realize he'd have
the nerve to lie on the stand.

528
00:20:03,295 --> 00:20:05,863
It's not exactly a giant leap
from killing someone.

529
00:20:05,898 --> 00:20:07,799
Perjury and murder,
they aren't the same thing.

530
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:11,002
Yeah, murder's worse.

531
00:20:11,037 --> 00:20:12,637
It's easier.
Nobody's watching.

532
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,605
Let's go.

533
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,808
Mr. Black, what exactly
did Jill tell you

534
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:19,043
regarding the defendant?

535
00:20:19,078 --> 00:20:20,912
She told me
she felt trapped.

536
00:20:20,946 --> 00:20:22,513
I thought she was
talking about school,

537
00:20:22,548 --> 00:20:25,783
but now I know
what she meant.

538
00:20:25,818 --> 00:20:29,320
That letter was dated
a week before she was killed.

539
00:20:29,355 --> 00:20:30,788
She must have
broken up with him,

540
00:20:30,823 --> 00:20:33,090
and this is how
he paid her back.

541
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,296
Mr. Black, you said you didn't
see Jill Hodgkins

542
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,797
at all on the day
of the murder.

543
00:20:39,831 --> 00:20:41,265
- Is that correct?
- Correct.

544
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:42,699
So there'd be no reason
for your blood

545
00:20:42,734 --> 00:20:45,402
to be on any of her clothing
at all.

546
00:20:45,436 --> 00:20:46,970
No, there'd be no reason.

547
00:20:47,004 --> 00:20:49,439
Would you be willing
to have a  DNA test, Mr. Black?

548
00:20:49,473 --> 00:20:50,907
Objection, Your Honor.
Prejudicial.

549
00:20:50,941 --> 00:20:52,509
We'll pay for it,
if that's a problem.

550
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:53,810
Mr. Specter.

551
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,382
It's about the DNA,
and they can't spin that.

552
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,884
Detective Packel,

553
00:21:01,918 --> 00:21:04,253
the dress wasn't the only
article of clothing

554
00:21:04,287 --> 00:21:05,387
that you submitted,
was it?

555
00:21:05,422 --> 00:21:07,556
No, there was a camisole.

556
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,124
Was it in your report?

557
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:10,859
Yeah, if you bothered
to read it.

558
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:12,194
I did read it, Detective.

559
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:14,930
And what was the DNA analysis
on that camisole?

560
00:21:14,964 --> 00:21:17,265
- I never picked it up.
- Why is that?

561
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:18,966
Well, it wasn't ready
till two days later

562
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:20,568
and we already had enough
from the dress.

563
00:21:20,602 --> 00:21:22,002
Enough?

564
00:21:22,037 --> 00:21:23,270
A man's life is at stake.

565
00:21:23,305 --> 00:21:24,305
Enough for what?

566
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:25,706
Enough for you
to put him away

567
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,474
without bringing it up
for 12 years.

568
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:28,809
Well, I did
pick up that test,

569
00:21:28,843 --> 00:21:30,110
along with the camisole.

570
00:21:30,145 --> 00:21:32,346
Your Honor, I'd like
to request a side bar.

571
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,480
On what grounds?

572
00:21:33,515 --> 00:21:35,883
The camisole and any evidence
connected to it

573
00:21:35,918 --> 00:21:36,918
are inadmissible.

574
00:21:43,863 --> 00:21:44,863
This is bullshit.

575
00:21:44,897 --> 00:21:46,698
Easy.
What?

576
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:48,567
Your Honor, in between

577
00:21:48,601 --> 00:21:50,001
picking up the camisole
at the precinct

578
00:21:50,036 --> 00:21:51,803
and dropping it off
at the lab,

579
00:21:51,837 --> 00:21:53,772
you can see here
the document is flawed.

580
00:21:53,806 --> 00:21:55,240
Therefore, the chain
of possession

581
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:57,808
with respect to the camisole
was broken.

582
00:21:57,842 --> 00:21:59,209
You gotta be kidding me.

583
00:21:59,244 --> 00:22:01,512
It's inadmissible.

584
00:22:04,248 --> 00:22:07,051
First six.

585
00:22:07,085 --> 00:22:08,152
What?

586
00:22:08,186 --> 00:22:11,422
First six months
are the hardest.

587
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,491
In your mind.

588
00:22:15,795 --> 00:22:18,397
I don't know if I can
do that again.

589
00:22:18,432 --> 00:22:22,202
Mr. Specter, you are
accusing a police officer

590
00:22:22,236 --> 00:22:24,237
of tampering with evidence.

591
00:22:24,272 --> 00:22:25,372
Yes, I am.

592
00:22:25,406 --> 00:22:27,207
When the results
of the DNA test came back,

593
00:22:27,241 --> 00:22:28,475
they didn't line up,

594
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:30,944
and Detective Packel
changed the custody documents.

595
00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:33,347
Even if Mr. Specter's
assertions were true,

596
00:22:33,381 --> 00:22:35,082
it would automatically
taint the evidence anyway.

597
00:22:35,116 --> 00:22:36,416
He's got a point.

598
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,218
That camisole
was what allowed us

599
00:22:38,252 --> 00:22:39,919
to reopen this case
in the first place.

600
00:22:39,954 --> 00:22:42,256
The camisole was proof
that evidence was buried.

601
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,591
That's why the case
was reopened.

602
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,125
An entirely separate issue

603
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,561
from whether that evidence
can be used in this trial.

604
00:22:48,595 --> 00:22:50,096
Clifford...

605
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,663
I don't know what's
going on in there,

606
00:22:51,698 --> 00:22:54,633
but no matter what they rule,

607
00:22:54,668 --> 00:22:56,235
he's not gonna
lose this one.

608
00:22:57,804 --> 00:22:58,770
You sure?

609
00:22:58,804 --> 00:23:00,171
Yeah.

610
00:23:00,206 --> 00:23:01,172
I am.

611
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:03,108
- Your Honor...
- What's enough.

612
00:23:03,142 --> 00:23:05,042
I'm instructing the jury
to disregard

613
00:23:05,077 --> 00:23:08,012
all testimony relating
to either the camisole

614
00:23:08,046 --> 00:23:09,914
or the resulting DNA test.

615
00:23:14,486 --> 00:23:16,321
Oh, my goodness.
I'm so sorry.

616
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:19,258
- Are you okay?
- Get out of my face.

617
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:21,259
What the hell are you doing,
reopening this?

618
00:23:21,294 --> 00:23:22,661
You worried
about getting caught

619
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:23,762
intentionally
tainting evidence?

620
00:23:23,797 --> 00:23:25,064
I didn't taint anything.

621
00:23:25,098 --> 00:23:26,698
What I did was help you
put away a guilty man

622
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:28,701
for brutally killing
a young girl.

623
00:23:28,735 --> 00:23:31,203
I'm not gonna let you drag my
reputation through the gutter.

624
00:23:31,238 --> 00:23:32,805
Not without consequences.

625
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,274
Are you threatening me?

626
00:23:34,308 --> 00:23:35,776
'Cause the truth is,
you wouldn't even be here

627
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,511
if you hadn't
done something wrong.

628
00:23:37,545 --> 00:23:39,080
Me? Yeah.

629
00:23:39,114 --> 00:23:40,815
That's all well and good
for you to drag up shit

630
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:42,050
from the past, huh?

631
00:23:42,084 --> 00:23:43,318
You're protected by
you shiny suit, right?

632
00:23:43,352 --> 00:23:44,819
What are you talking about?

633
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:46,421
Lawyers never
go after their own.

634
00:23:46,455 --> 00:23:48,323
What is that Denzel movie?

635
00:23:48,357 --> 00:23:51,592
"Tell it to me
like I'm a five-year-old."

636
00:23:51,626 --> 00:23:54,095
Sometimes, the good guys
gotta do bad things

637
00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:55,696
to make the bad guys pay.

638
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:01,901
It's time to start painting
outside the lines.

639
00:24:01,936 --> 00:24:03,569
How?

640
00:24:03,604 --> 00:24:05,405
If Mohammed won't
come to the mountain,

641
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:07,674
we need to bring the mountain
to Mohammed.

642
00:24:07,709 --> 00:24:10,410
Really?
The mountain to Mohammed.

643
00:24:10,445 --> 00:24:12,079
- It's a thing.
- Yeah, I know.

644
00:24:12,113 --> 00:24:14,315
It just has no meaning to me
in this situation.

645
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,417
You said you could
think like me.

646

00:37:13,006 --> 00:37:16,175
We knew Jason
would send somebody.

974
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,410
What?

975
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:18,612
Who do you think
told Jason

976
00:37:18,646 --> 00:37:19,913
you went to the police
in the first place?

977
00:37:19,948 --> 00:37:21,649
I did...
Harvey showed me the results

978
00:37:21,683 --> 00:37:23,184
of the DNA test.

979
00:37:23,218 --> 00:37:24,218
Two splotches.

980
00:37:24,252 --> 00:37:26,754
Jason Black's and yours.

981

[Exhales]

982
00:37:29,158 --> 00:37:31,626
Okay, um...

983
00:37:31,661 --> 00:37:33,562
Uh, I want to file
a report.

984
00:37:33,596 --> 00:37:35,831
Oh.

985
00:37:35,865 --> 00:37:36,998
Sure.

986
00:37:37,033 --> 00:37:38,299
I'll take you downtown.

987
00:37:38,334 --> 00:37:39,534
You can look
through the books.

988
00:37:39,568 --> 00:37:40,902
Maybe you find something.

989
00:37:40,936 --> 00:37:42,003
Maybe you don't.

990
00:37:42,037 --> 00:37:43,804
But your real problem
isn't that guy.

991
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:45,706
It's Jason Black.

992
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:48,341
Somebody was gonna
turn him in once before.

993
00:37:48,376 --> 00:37:50,677
And I think you know
the lengths he'll go to...

994
00:37:50,711 --> 00:37:52,345
to shut somebody up.

995
00:37:52,379 --> 00:37:54,714
No, I don't.
No, I don't.

996
00:37:54,748 --> 00:37:56,716
We were here this time.
We won't be here next time.

997
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,884
Next time?
What would have happened

998
00:37:57,918 --> 00:37:59,352
if he would have
killed me this time?

999
00:37:59,387 --> 00:38:01,354
Well, you'd be dead,
and we'd have caught the guy

1000
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:03,523
and used him to put Jason away
for murder.

1001
00:38:03,557 --> 00:38:04,724
Shit, we should have
done that.

1002
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:06,593
- Yeah.
- Harvey, behave.

1003
00:38:06,628 --> 00:38:08,095
What do you want?
What do you want from me?

1004
00:38:08,129 --> 00:38:09,296
What do you want
from me?!

1005
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,731
Confess to the crime.

1006
00:38:10,765 --> 00:38:12,132
Turn in Jason Black.

1007
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:13,467
No, I can't do that.

1008
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:14,735
Yes, you can.
I'll tell you why.

1009
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:16,503
You were 16.

1010
00:38:16,538 --> 00:38:17,571
A juvenile.

1011
00:38:17,605 --> 00:38:19,039
That's three years maximum.

1012
00:38:19,073 --> 00:38:20,374
Less, if you're the one
who comes forward.

1013
00:38:20,408 --> 00:38:21,408
We'll get you a deal.

1014
00:38:21,442 --> 00:38:22,542
No, you can't
make that promise.

1015
00:38:22,577 --> 00:38:23,610
You're not the D.A.

1016
00:38:23,644 --> 00:38:24,744
You'd rather negotiate
with Jason?

1017
00:38:24,779 --> 00:38:26,612
Because he'll kill you,

1018
00:38:26,647 --> 00:38:28,114
and you know it.

1019
00:38:28,148 --> 00:38:29,882
It was his idea.
I didn't wanna do it.

1020
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:31,984
I didn't
wanna do it.

1021
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,720
Okay. Get dressed
and come with me.

1022
00:38:34,754 --> 00:38:36,922
Go.

1023
00:38:36,956 --> 00:38:39,691
Hey, by the way,
where'd you get that bruise?

1024
00:38:39,726 --> 00:38:42,461
Sometimes the good guys
got to do bad things...

1025
00:38:42,496 --> 00:38:43,963
Both: To make
the bad guys pay.

1026
00:38:43,997 --> 00:38:45,164
That's right.

[Sighs]

1028
00:38:49,002 --> 00:38:50,402
What?

1029
00:38:50,437 --> 00:38:52,671
What? Should have
let me do the talking.

1030
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:53,939
Wouldn't work.
You're not ready yet.

1031
00:38:53,974 --> 00:38:56,175
Not ready?
This whole thing was my idea.

1032
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,177
You lost in housing court.

1033
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,779
You think you could
handle a murderer?

You're welcome.

1035

I let you say
the juvenile thing.

1036
00:39:03,684 --> 00:39:05,351
That was pretty bad-ass,
wasn't it?

1037
00:39:06,654 --> 00:39:08,822
Really?
Thought I nailed it.

Hey, Mike, it's Rachel.

00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,707
I know I shouldn't
be doing this,

1041
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:29,575
and I--I know you're
seeing Jenny,

1042
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:32,912
but I--I can't stop
thinking about the kiss.

1043
00:39:32,946 --> 00:39:35,915
And...I can't go back.

up and confessed.

We'll get your client out.

1047
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:47,927
I'll back your motion
to expunge his record.

1048
00:39:47,962 --> 00:39:49,663
I'll facilitate his release.

1049
00:39:51,499 --> 00:39:53,067
You don't seem very happy.

1050
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:57,104
You think I don't know
you set those boys up

1051
00:39:57,138 --> 00:39:58,405
and coerced that whole thing?

1052
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,973
Set 'em up?
How would I do that?

1053
00:40:00,008 --> 00:40:01,475
I don't know.
What difference does that make?

1054
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:03,210
- I know you did it.
- You know?

1055

The same way you knew
Clifford was guilty?

No, you don't get to tell me

two guilty ones in.

think that they were
texting each other?

1070

- You.

Yeah, but they're
not gonna think that.

That's cool.
You'd make a good criminal.

Yeah, better than you.

Uh, excuse me,
I was an amazing criminal.

a mechanical failure,

happened to anybody.

- How do you have this memory?
