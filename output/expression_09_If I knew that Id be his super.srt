1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,530
I wonder why that is.
Oh, yeah.
왜 그럴까. 아, 맞다.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,870
It's the day
they announce my promotion.
내 승진을 발표하는

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,440
Jimmy, have you lost weight?
날이잖아.

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,570
Steve-O.
지미, 살 빠졌니?

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,310
Looking like a guy
who came to work.
스티브-오.

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,610
Excuse me,
why are you scratching off
일하러 온 사람처럼

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,950
the senior off my door?
보이는군.

8
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,950
I got a work order
to take it off.
실례합니다,

9
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,950
- Who issued the work order?
- My supervisor.
왜 제 문에 있는 '선임'을

10
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,950
Why did he issue
the work order?
긁어내고 있습니까?

11
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,960
If I knew that,
I'd be his supervisor.
그걸 떼라는
