as you can see from these logs it looks like we are sending a llm reques twice
one for entire script , then expression "14:33:09 | INFO     | Translating expression 'break a sweat' to ko"
this is unnecessary since the translation of expression can be found in first call 
I haven't check the code base if we are actually sending it to llm again but this is absolutely unnecessary

Second issue

I think our current multiple media creation process is not optimal.
reason I think is when I run it in test mode, create 1 video takes less then 20 seconds
and when I run entire episodes, it takes hours to finish, end up create 20~30 videos
I want you to take a look at this , workflow , how it works and find how we can optimize it
