1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,670
Harvey,I don't need a perp
walk or a front page headline.

2
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,000
I just want the person responsible.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,900
Then hand me the deal we just
negotiated and justice will be served.

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,380
You know what,if this
were anyone else but you,

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,650
I wouldn't even be giving
the courtesy of this meeting.

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:28,250
Becky,we're both benefiting from
this. You've got nothing on my client.

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,760
And I'm gonna help you
get the person responsible.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,740
So why don't we just go do that?

9
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,230
You better make sure miss stone signs
this. Otherwise,we don't have a deal.

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,980
- How long have we known each other?
- Since you were in the DA's office.

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,780
Then you know we'll have a deal.

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,640
****

13
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,300
- How'd it go with the department of justice?
- Follow me,you'll find out.

14
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,640
- I get to sit in?
- With your head down and your mouth shut.

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,170
This isn't a usual

16
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,820
What are you doing? Quick. Act like
you're telling me something important.

17
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,530
- I am telling you something important.
- And then after the injunction,

18
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,100
you know,both parties
decided to reassess--

19
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,320
My God. That woman with Rachel, I took
the lsats for her a couple years ago.

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,930
If she saw me,she could blow my cover.

21
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,740
Oh,really? And how would that go?

22
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,950
"Excuse me,when I was cheating for my lsats, that
was the guy who took the test for me"? Come on.

23
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,910
It could go down like that. You
don't know. People say things.

24
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,300
Miss stone,correct me if any of this is
wrong, but you and I both know it's not.

25
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,110
Please address me and
not my client,Mr. specter.

26
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,740
You mean your client who purchased
$10 million in Lunardi pharmaceuticals

27
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,560
and then a day later word of their fda approval
got out and the stock shot up to $30 million?

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,790
She purchased that stock for your
clients, Burt Kimball and Dean Morello,

29
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,820
based on a tip sheet
handed out by your clients.

30
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,130
An allegation that
tainted their reputation,

31
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,190
yet the DOJ looked into
it and found nothing.

32
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,320
That doesn't mean it didn't happen.

33
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,920
I'll turn your client over
in person,no handcuffs.

34
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,690
It'll be a country club prison.

35
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,130
And I'll make sure she's processed as
gently as possible as long as she admits

36
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,990
that she made this
trade of her own accord.

37
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,930
It's a crappy deal
wrapped in pretty paper.

38
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,960
Why aren't we dealing with
the department of justice?

39
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,980
Because the DOJ wanted to put you behind bars
for seven years,and I got 'em down to 11 months.

40
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,830
Look,it's a great deal.

41
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,850
You're gonna sign it,you're
gonna serve your year in prison,

42
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,650
and every night when you climb into your
bunk, you're gonna thank your lucky stars

43
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,500
that Harvey specter
negotiated on your behalf.

44
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,050
Nobody's ever gonna believe me, and I don't
have the resources to fight this thing forever.

45
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,890
So I'll sign the goddamn deal.

46
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:45,050
But I'm not thanking anybody.

47
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,620
Harvey,you came through.

48
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,260
My company's reputation means
everything to me. Thank you.

49
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,830
So I trust we won't be hearing from
the department of justice again?

50
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,750
Unless you plan on inviting them to
the company's Christmas party,Bert,no.

51
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,070
- I told Morello you could fix this for us.
- Thank you,Harvey.

52
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:16,200
Reality's starting to sink in.
Gabby's a little wound up right now.

53
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,970
Let's give her a minute.

54
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,670
I've got the pretty papers in
my office for you to look over.

55
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,620
Keep an eye on her.

56
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:36,140
- You here to make sure I don't change my mind about the deal?
- No.

57
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,740
Would you?

58
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,210
You know,my father was a teacher.

59
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,360
He worked hard,followed the rules.

60
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,910
Last year,the district cut his
pension to save their budget.

61
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:54,370
I went to wall street so I could make some
money before getting into teaching myself.

62
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:02,280
I never thought I'd have to worry
if they let convicted felons teach.

63
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,920
Can I get you some water or something?

64
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,030
I'm just gonna get you some water.

65
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,130
- I got it.
- Thanks.

66
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,330
- So that girl you were with earlier, she a friend of yours?
- Theresa,yeah.

67
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,130
She used to be a paralegal
here. We were pretty close.

68
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,620
She worked at Pearson,hardman?

69
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,800
And I just had the unique pleasure of giving her
the summer intern tour for prospective employees.

70
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,930
- Really?
- Yeah.

71
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,740
She's in her second year of Harvard law,
meeting with the partners as we speak.

72
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,100
I know. We used to do
everything together.

73
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,620
And now,if she gets this job,she
will technically be my boss.

74
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,350
Oh,God. I'm so sorry,Rachel.
Do you need to talk about it?

75
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,400
No. Not now. Thanks.

76
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,200
- Oh,no,no. No.
- What?

77
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,660
She's gone.

78
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:09,120

<font color=#38B0DE>Suits S01E06</font>

81
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,990
You left her alone to get her a water?

82
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,220
- What,she didn't want a latte?
- I was trying to be helpful.

83
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,750
You were very helpful to her.

84
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,240
You didn't see her,Harvey. She
was scared. She was a wreck.

85
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,500
Maybe that had to do with the fact that
she was about to go to prison for 11 months.

86
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
I think she was having the
reaction of an innocent woman.

87
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,980
And what was telling you that? Your
years of investigative experience?

88
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,920
- You know,I just-I listened to her,that's
all. - Let me tell you something,okay.

89
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,220
Just because a pretty girl tells
you a story doesn't mean it's true.

90
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,320
If she'd gone to trial, the burden
of proof would be on the prosecution,

91
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,680
yet her own lawyer told
her to take the deal.

92
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,130
Not to mention that
innocent people don't run.

93
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,960
I think this fell out of
her purse. I found it here.

94
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,320
- Why are you telling me this now?
- Because you were mad at me before.

95
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,580
So your answer to that is to delay
giving me important information?

96
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,210
- Well,when you put it like that.
- Okay,I got to smooth things over with the DOJ.

97
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,940
That phone is our only lead. Try not
to lose it before I get back. Okay?

98
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,930
******

99
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,250
Becky,there's been a slight
hiccup on the Gabby stone business.

100
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,840
I don't want to hear about any
hiccups. Did she sign the deal or not?

101
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,890
Well,she was about to.

102
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,960
My associate left her alone
for a second, and she took off.

103
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,530
- Gabby stone's in the wind?
- "In the wind"? Really?

104
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,720
The woman isn't a world-class
felon. She'll turn up.

105
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,590
Well,it better be soon,or the deal's off
the table and I'm going after your clients.

106
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,450
That's funny. I don't think so.

107
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,730
The sec decided they had no case,
and their burden of proof is lower.

108
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,070
If you had something on my clients,
you would have charged them already.

109
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,710
Harvey,I went out on a limb for you.

110
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:18,710
You make me look bad on this,
I promise you,you'll regret it.

111
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,570
Donna,where the hell's Mike?

112
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,870
Hey,anyone know a guy named Bradley?

113
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,990
Ball! The guy's who
about to miss the jumper.

114
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,140
- Do you have a last name?
- Brickstein.

115
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,960
- Do I look like I have time for jokes?
- Reger.

116
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,110
Bradley.

117
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,580
Mr. reger.

118
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,820
Bradley reger!

119
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,570
Sorry,can I help you?

120
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,320
I'm sure you've heard about the
investigation regarding Gabby stone.

121
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,480
Are you with the department of justice?

122
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:31,060
I... I have several questions for you.

123
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,210
Did you help Gabby when she was
charged with insider trading?

124
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,800
Of course I did. She wasn't
just a trader. She was my friend.

125
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,620
I recommended a lawyer and let her borrow
some cash after you guys froze her account.

126
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,320
That was Henderson. He's
a stickler for procedure.

127
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,420
Tell me,when was the
last time you saw her?

128
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,160
Bradley,let me inform you that
withholding knowledge of the whereabouts

129
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,440
of a known fugitive is a federal
offense. Do you understand me?

130
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,390
Gabby came in here 20 minutes ago.

131
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:00,140
She asked to borrow my keycard to Morello
assets offices, and I gave it to her.

132
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,940
Well,the department
appreciates your honesty.

133
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,500
Oh,and,Mr. reger,put a little
arc in your jump shot,all right?

134
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,420
If poor shooting were a crime, I'd
be forced to arrest you right here.

135
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,080
It's embarrassing. Go get 'em.

136
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,500
Harvey,I know where she is.

137
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,820
What are you doing here?
I told you I'd get her.

138
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,990
And I would let you. I just wanted to
make sure she didn't get away again.

139
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,940
The water was right
outside the room,okay?

140
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,080
And you said innocent people don't run.

141
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,580
Do guilty people run back
to the scene of the crime?

142
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,230
You don't know what she's doing.

143
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,630
She could be planning on taking a baseball
bat to all these computers for all we know.

144
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,860
Gabby,what are you doing?

145
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,560
That stock was on my tip
sheet. It was on mine.

146
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,560
If I could find that tip sheet,
I could prove my innocence.

147
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,340
Is this what guilty people do?

148
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,960
- I know they're your clients, but can you help me,please?
- I'm sorry.

149
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,520
You can either come with us,

150
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,050
or we'll have the department
of justice bring you in.

151
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,670
So I meant to ask you, how did your
friend's interview go yesterday?

152
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,040
Theresa? She didn't get the internship.

153
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,120
- So how do you feel about that?
- To be honest,I'm relieved.

154
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,680
I mean,she would have been a daily
reminder of what I couldn't do,

155
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,450
that I'll never score high enough
on the lsats or get into law school.

156
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,510
You know,that doesn't have to be true.

157
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:42,940
It is. I need to accept that I will always
be a paralegal because of this stupid test.

158
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,880
- I had a hard time sleeping last night. You want to know why?
- No.

159
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,830
Because Gabby stone is innocent.

160
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,700
- Oh,I slept like a baby.
- I don't think you believe that.

161
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,190
You think she's innocent too.
You just don't want to pursue it.

162
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,440
- She's not our client.
- No,Morello is our client.

163
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,240
And if someone else in that office
is responsible and they do it again,

164
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,040
won't that put our client in jeopardy?

165
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,030
Ooh,yep. I'm right,and you know it.

166
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,890
And now you have the
responsibility to investigate.

167
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,520
Did you tell that guy
at the basketball court

168
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,000
that you were an attorney
for the department of justice?

169
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,180
Not explicitly.

170
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,310
I mean,people hear
what they want to hear.

171
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,230
I won't impersonate
a federal agent again.

172
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,000
Probably a good idea.

173
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,790
Oh,hey,Mike,can I give you my
roommate's cat for the weekend?

174
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,970
Let's get it over with. I
have some actual work to do.

175
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,610
No,no,no,it's not what you
think. It's just very annoying,

176
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:00,060
and I figured if you were looking after
it, the cat's as good as gone,right?

177
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,220
Gentlemen. What's going on?

178
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,620
Some sort of shenanigans?

179
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,070
Uh,no,it's nothing. It's
just stuff between associates.

180
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,130
I said,"what's going on?"

181
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,080
Seth's just giving me a hard time
for losing Gabby stone yesterday.

182
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:21,240
Oh,but we know at this firm that we don't
dwell on our colleagues' mistakes, right?

183
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,710
I mean,just because one of your fellow
associates is incompetent doesn't mean

184
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,690
you have to constantly remind this moron
what a careless idiot he really is,right?

185
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,410
You.

186
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,350
Harold,I called you two nights ago, and you
didn't answer your phone, which is really funny,

187
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,540
because you're a first-year associate, who's
lucky enough to be working here at pearson/hardman,

188
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,760
so,when I need to get a hold of you,
you will be reachable at all times.

189
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,240
I don't care if you're in a coma,
hospital that's been burning down,

190
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,040
your mother's about to jump
off the Brooklyn bridge,

191
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,380
- you will pick up your phone.
- Absolutely.

192
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,940
- Got it?
- Yes.

193
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,260
******

194
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,930
Okay,thanks. Can you
leave my office,please?

195
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,800
Harvey,once this whole
Morello thing gets fixed,

196
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,760
remind me to be irritated with you for
not billing more on the Swindon merger.

197
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,910
The fact is mergers are boring,okay?

198
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,850
Plus,I'm busy. Also,mergers? Boring.

199
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,350
How'd you get these?

200
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,910
Oh,you mean tickets to the royal Shakespeare
company's production of king lear?

201
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,290
This show was sold out the
minute these tickets went on sale.

202
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,050
I live for king lear.How
did you know that?

203
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,860
- It's my job to know that.
- But why?

204
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,290
Louis,your billables are outstanding.

205
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,090
You've landed three
high-profile clients in a month,

206
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,700
and I want to show you my appreciation.

207
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,150
And I'm very happy that you're excited.

208
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,690
So should we get dinner
before or after the play?

209
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,970
Uh,um,I-I don't know.

210
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,150
Jessica,do you remember when
we went to that yankee game

211
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,730
and you caught that foul ball
and you ate all my nachos?

212
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,710
Did we go to the steakhouse that
night? Oh,that was a good meal.

213
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,750
Have a good time.

214
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,070
- You know what,Louis,dinner after.
- I'll have Norma make a reservation.

215
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,230
Fantastic.

216
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,360
Dean,Gabby stone's still making
noises about these tip sheets.

217
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,970
She insists that she had a different
sheet on the day she bought Lunardi.

218
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,110
She was lying.

219
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,620
I understand,but,after she broke
into your offices last night,

220
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,080
the DOJ might be inclined to
start rattling cases again.

221
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,590
So,for the record, you're
telling me the truth,right?

222
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:43,260
Harvey, you work for me,remember?

223
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,800
Well,as your lawyer,I need to be able
to tell the DOJ we're all aboveboard.

224
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,480
- Of course.
- So you won't mind if I look around for myself?

225
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,370
We've had a clean record for 50 years.

226
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,140
Please,Harvey,look around.

227
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,500
Why is that on my desk? 'Cause
the lsats are a week from Saturday.

228
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,440
- Great. Go away. I'm busy.
- There are only four tests a year,which means,

229
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,590
if you miss this one,you're gonna
have to wait another three months.

230
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,730
I can do math too, good will hunting.

231
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,290
- When did I say I was ready to retake the
lsats? - I thought that,after our talk--

232
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,880
Nothing about our talk said I'm
interested in bombing the test again.

233
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,590
- You're not gonna bomb it again.
- How do you know?

234
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:22,570
Because the first time you took it,you
were missing one essential ingredient...

235
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,330
- Me.
- Not interested.

236
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,570
If I let you help me,
will you leave me alone?

237
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,680
- Okay.
- I'll see you later. Get excited.

238
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,310
Hey,I forget,why are we
looking into Gabby stone again?

239
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,550
Oh,right,because I said she's
innocent, and now you agree with me.

240
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,670
No,I don't agree with
you that she's innocent,

241
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,850
but,if there's even the slightest
chance that someone else is involved,

242
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,590
they're putting the whole company
at risk, and I can't have that.

243
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,810
Okay,so you disagree
with what we agree about?

244
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,280
Oh,I'll agree with that.

245
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,520
- I don't feel sorry for Gabby stone at all.
- Because?

246
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,590
I found her. I was her immediate
supervisor. I nurtured her.

247
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,610
Then she tries to cheat
and give us a bad name.

248
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,760
How commonplace would
you say cheating is here?

249
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,280
It's not. It's not the
kind of shop we run.

250
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,170
So when miss stone made the trade and the
investment tripled in value, you weren't suspicious?

251
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,290
My job's not to worry about the
traders that are making money.

252
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:30,040
My job's to worry about
the traders who aren't.

253
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,730
So how exactly does the
tip sheet system work?

254
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,030
Our technical analyst predicts stocks that are
likely to have larger-than-expected volatility.

255
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,740
These predictions are handed out to our traders
on a daily basis in the form of a tip sheet.

256
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,550
All these traders get
the same tip sheet?

257
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,090
Exactly. They're printed on red
paper, so they can't be copied.

258
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,930
Every trader is responsible for returning
their sheet at the end of the day,

259
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,340
- so they can be shredded.
- So no records exist?

260
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,610
We keep electronic copies.

261
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,610
I'll need to see those
copies for the last year.

262
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:27,060
- I thought you might. I'm assuming you own a computer.
- One more thing.

263
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,950
I'll need to see a list of all the trades
Morello assets made in the last year.

264
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,310
- Well,I can't give you that.
- Why not?

265
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,310
Tip sheets have expired.

266
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,890
But our current positions-That's
proprietary information.

267
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,960
And I can't release
that on just your say-so.

268
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,140
That's not a request. We
need to protect the company.

269
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,030
And we're covered under
attorney-client privilege.

270
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,250
And I'm telling you
I'm not giving you shit.

271
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,720
You think I don't know what
attorney-client privilege is?

272
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,440
You know,you corporate lawyers
look down your noses at us

273
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,870
because we didn't go
to Ivy league schools.

274
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,870
Just because I don't have a fancy degree doesn't mean
you get to come into my house and order me around.

275
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:04,490
And you go whine to Morello and I'll knock
you on your ass like the pussy you are.

276
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,270
Well,Sam,I'm sorry
that you feel that way,

277
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,660
but I've been working for your boss
Dean Morello for a very long time,

278
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,810
and let me tell you something.

279
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,650
You try to stonewall me, you'll be
out on the street in less than a week.

280
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,480
As for the other stuff, do I
think that I'm smarter than you?

281
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,060
You're damn right I do.

282
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:27,510
But if you think that means that I can't
kick your ass up and down this floor,

283
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,880
take a swing and see what happens.

284
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,360
I didn't think so.

285
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,530
That was amazing.

286
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,620
It was like he was Mr.
t and you were rocky,

287
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,360
but not like rocky at the beginning
when he was all scared of Mr. t,

288
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,670
but at the end, when he was all like,

289
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,860
"ooh,give it your best shot." You know?

290
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,760
"Adrian!" Yes!

291
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,110
That's funny,but you might want
to wipe that grin off your face.

292
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,040
What? Why?

293
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,580
Because without those trades, we don't have
shit,and your little girlfriend's gonna rot in jail.

294
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,510
And by the way,you got
to work on your Stallone.

295
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,680
You need a lower register.

296
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,750
That was an incredible Stallone.

297
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,900
I've been doing that since I
was a kid,and you can't touch it.

298
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,440
Don't do that with food in your mouth.

299
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,810
No,I swallowed it.

300
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,630
There's food in your mouth.

301
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,370
- "Adrian."
- That's disgusting.

302
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,960
- Come on. You got this one.
- It's "A".

303
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,150
No,it's "C". Actually,it's
"D". It's definitely "D".

304
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:29,030
- Final answer?
- Yes,"D".

305
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,640
It's "A".

306
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,480
Rachel,you got to remember they're asking
why the argument is most vulnerable.

307
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,930
I can make the case that
they're all vulnerable arguments.

308
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,310
You could,but your first instinct
was "A". You got to go with your gut.

309
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:43,030
Right.So what if my gut can find
the exception where "a" is wrong.

310
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,660
- What am I supposed to do then?
- You ignore it.

311
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,170
I can't. That's easier said than done.

312
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,390
- The test isn't trying to trick you,Rachel.
- But sometimes it is,Mike.

313
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,300
- Well,you got to let that go.
- I can't.

314
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,010
- Why not?
- 'Cause I don't want to get any questions wrong.

315
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,680
Okay. I think we found your problem.

316
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,850
You're so afraid of getting
fooled by a few trick questions

317
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,540
that you're letting it mess
you up with all the other ones.

318
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,360
Look,Rachel,you want to get into
Harvard, you need a 170. Okay?

319
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,710
If you let a few of these trick
questions go, you're gonna be fine.

320
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,700
But if you keep trying to be perfect,
you're gonna overthink this whole thing.

321
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,420
You're gonna end up with a 130.

322
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,640
Rachel. Nobody gets
all the trick questions.

323
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,660
What about you?

324
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:28,140
First grade, they gave me an achievement
test. I scored in the 99th percentile,

325
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:33,110
so they kept giving me achievement tests
all the way up to the eighth grade level.

326
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:36,540
And I kept getting in the 99th
percentile with every one of 'em.

327
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,520
You couldn't get the 100th?

328
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,670
There is no 100th.

329
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,720
Next question. Come on.

330
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,450
- King lear.
- I happen to like king lear.

331
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,660
And unlike some people I know, Louis's
references don't begin and end with top gun.

332
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,000
Hey,I love Louis,and I don't care what
you say,I am not leaving my wingman.

333
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,740
See,that's funny,because
that's from top gun.

334
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,710
He's a wild card. Flies
by the seat of his pants.

335
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,260
Think I can't quote top gun.
Get the hell out of here.

336
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,810
Oh,that was good.

337
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,570
Hey,Mike. Burt Kimball's
coming to see me.

338
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,560
- I need you in the meeting.
- Oh,the number two at Morello?

339
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,610
Bet he's coming to yell at you after
your big showdown there yesterday.

340
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,390
If you need me,I got your back.

341
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,160
Thinking about finally
going to law school?

342
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,880
- Oh,no,I'm helping Rachel study.
- Pretty paralegal. Got it.

343
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,180
Okay. It's not like that.
It's exactly like that.

344
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,750
Oh,that reminds me.

345
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,300
How did you manage to
take the lsats for a woman?

346
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,020
- What do you mean?
- We took the test the same day.

347
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,330
She signed my name on
hers,and I signed hers on mine.

348
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:45,150
- Why? What's so funny?
- I just pictured you in drag.

349
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:49,710
I could pull that off.
I've got soft features.

350
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,190
I want to apologize
for Samuel's behavior.

351
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:57,680
He's had a chip on his shoulder ever since the department
of justice investigated miss stone's malfeasance.

352
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,520
He's very protective of the firm.

353
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,790
That's a good man to
have in your corner.

354
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,330
Well,so are you.

355
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:08,550
In these folders,you'll find every trade
made by Morello assets in the last year.

356
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,060
Personally delivered by
Burt Kimball,I'm flattered.

357
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,220
Well,we just want to make sure
you've got everything you need,Harvey.

358
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,420
We really appreciate your diligence.

359
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,280
Now I better get back to the office.

360
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,700
The Australian markets
are just opening up.

361
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,230
Good to see you. Always a pleasure,Burt.

362
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,860
Harvey,this is great.

363
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,370
We can take these tip sheets and
put them-- What are you doing?

364
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,830
This guy's not that friendly to his own
mother. He's hiding something,and I'm pissed.

365
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,060
- What are you talking about?
- Those aren't the real trades.

366
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,490
Okay. So how do we get them?

367
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,910
Right. How do I get them?

368
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,680
- Hello?
- You figure out how to get the most profitable trades yet,Mike?

369
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,770
The Morello brokers hang out at a bar
called the closing bell.I'm on my way now.

370
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,540
Good. Remember you're working.
I'll talk to you later.

371
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,800
Can I get a beer?

372
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,890
Thanks.

373
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,350
Hey,hey,hey,what's up,toolbox?

374
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:10,100
Oh,man. You know,you drink that beer any
slower,I'm gonna have to get you a nipple.

375
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,990
- Do I know you?
- Vince Landis,Morello asset.

376
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:18,450
- Yeah,that's me.
- Yeah. Russell Ginther.

377
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,910
The Ginth. The Ginthesizer.

378
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,730
- What are you talking about?
- Come on,Gervich investments.

379
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,820
Man,we got shithoused here a couple weeks
ago. I have no idea what you're talking about.

380
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,400
You,me,Pepiol,Causwell, Williamson.

381
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,130
That guy,dick. You
still owe me 20 bucks.

382
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,050
- Yeah,right.
- Russell.Right,Russell.

383
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:38,740
You still begging for scraps over
there at Gervich or what? You wish.

384
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,190
Hey,I need a shot. What is this?

385
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,650
No,drink mine,please.

386
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,810
Jaeger? You're better than that,man.

387
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,200
Money!

388
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,070
God,you guys are a bunch of pussies.

389
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:03,020
I guarantee you my biggest trades kick
the ass out of your biggest trades.

390
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,280
I don't think so,brother.

391
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:09,370
Last month,I made $2 million
on Cahill metal in one hour.

392
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,330
$2 million? I made $4 million off
of Montroluxx back in February.

393
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,700
That stock tripled over night.What's up?

394
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,640
$4 million? Oh,that's adorable.

395
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,240
How about the $6 million I just
cleared on Rypien micro devices.

396
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,310
Oh,yeah? What do you think my boy
here made on Piper web systems?

397
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,980
- What,this guy?
- Right here.

398
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,200
Uh,I don't know. A pack of chewing
gum and your sister's panties.

399
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,220
Oh,it's on.

400
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,730
Vince Landis! $7 million
off of Drogin limited.

401
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,160
$8 million off of Epling RTX.

402
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,570
$9 million off of RMA
integrated products.

403
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:52,600
- Well,gentlemen,greed is good.
- So is his sister. Right?

404
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,970
Come on,man. That's his
sister. That's not cool.

405
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,750
Dude,you just made,like,the same joke.

406
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,600
Hey,Bradley's finally here.

407
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,890
Uh,all right,ladies. Listen,I
got to split. It's been real.

408
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,060
- I'll get drinks next time,all right?
- Right.

409
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,970
Make money,money,make money.

410
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:39,440
- Harvey. I got the trades.
- Good. We'll talk tomorrow.

411
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,370
- What? No. I'm coming over no
- You're drunk.

412
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:44,380
- Do not come over.
- All right. Cool. I'll see you in a minute.

413
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:53,830
Harvey,come on. We got
to save Gabby. Gabrilini.

414
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:58,500
- Oh,you got a sweet place,dude.
- Don't ever call me dude.

415
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:02,590
Do you think that maybe I could take it off
your hands, like,when you go out of town?

416
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:05,130
Like a house-sitting-type
situation?

417
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,680
Remind me to have Donna
get you a spare key.

418
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,240
- You have the trades?
- Tada.

419
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,850
- Good.
- Hey,when can we...

420
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,580
I'm still upset that I
didn't get the internship.

421
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,590
- It would have been so much fun to work together, don't you think?
- Oh,absolutely.

422
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,150
Let me ask you something.

423
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:24,080
How did you turn it
around with the lsats?

424
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,530
- What do you mean?
- Well,come on.

425
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,610
You took 'em,didn't do so well,
and now you're at Harvard law.

426
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:34,050
It's exactly what I want to
be doing. So you can tell me.

427
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,680
What'd you do,sleep with the grader?

428
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,500
What?

429
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:47,730
I paid someone to take them for me.

430
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,220
- What?
- There's this guy.

431
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,390
I heard about him from
a friend of a friend's.

432
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,830
Paid him 1,000 bucks and
he took the lsats for me.

433
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,750
- He got me a 172.
- You cheated on the lsats?

434
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,700
When we were paralegals,we were
smarter than half the associates.

435
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:11,770
Why should I be denied my chance
because I can't pass some stupid test?

436
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:14,330
I'm living my dream,Rache.

437
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:17,730
I'm not gonna apologize
for it to anyone.

438
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,610
Come on. Come on.

439
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:31,520
- Hello?
- Mikey,yo,it's Scott.

440
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,400
Scott? How are you,man? I
haven't talked to you in forever.

441
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,720
Are you still taking lsats for other
people? I got a customer for you.

442
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:44,000
No,man. I'm not in that
business anymore.I'm sorry.

443
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,540
Trust me. You want to take this
meeting,dude. This chick is smoking hot.

444
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:54,200
- What's her name?
- Rachel Zane.

445
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,260
- You didn't give her my name,did you?
- No. Of course not.

446
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,310
I'm not taking that meeting,man.

447
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,470
What do you want me to sign now?
A confession that I killed Kennedy?

448
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,310
I'm not gonna pretend to be
your best friend,miss stone.

449
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:37,790
But my interests happen to be aligned
with yours right now, so please sit down.

450
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,700
Your colleagues' most profitable trades.

451
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,000
Why are you showing them to me?

452
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,310
Every single one of them comes from stocks
that Morello assets didn't officially recommend.

453
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,570
This is either a hell of a coincidence,

454
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:56,000
or these traders were all
given different tip sheets.

455
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,960
So you believe me when I said my tip
sheet had Lunardi pharmaceuticals on it.

456
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,390
Well,I'm getting there, but
you got flagged by the DOJ.

457
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,430
And no one else at Morello
did, so I want to know why.

458
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,930
What's different here?

459
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:13,300
None of these trades are for more than $9
million. That's Morello's recommended amount.

460
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,420
And your Lunardi purchase
was for $10 million.

461
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:21,290
Maybe someone figured out that any trade
under $10 million wouldn't draw DOJ attention.

462
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:25,340
Why'd you make a trade for $1 million
more than the recommended amount?

463
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:29,790
Look at me. I'm not
exactly fraternity material.

464
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:33,660
It's a cutthroat world, and
I wasn't performing well.

465
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,550
So I took a chance,and
I tried to hit it big.

466
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:41,230
I picked the wrong trade.

467
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,580
Gabby,if you knew you were innocent,
then why didn't you fight this harder?

468
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:52,310
After I saw how much money the
trade made, I suspected something.

469
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,400
I went to Burt Kimball,

470
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,530
he reassured me that I made a
profitable trade and did nothing wrong.

471
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:03,970
He even told me I had a $300,000
bonus coming at the end of the quarter.

472
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,470
I should have gone to
someone, said something.

473
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:16,640
I made one mistake, and I'm gonna
regret it for the rest of my life.

474
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,870
Scott. Yeah,it's Mike Ross.

475
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,300
This Rachel Zane,tell
her I'll take the meeting.

476
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,070
- Just don't tell her my name.
- Who's that on the phone?

477
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,760
It's nothing.

478
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,720
- You thinking about Gabby?
- I'm thinking about her lawyer.

479
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,850
- What?
-  Knowing what she said,

480
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:54,840
why would that Zegan guy agree to a deal that puts
his client behind bars without even putting up a fight?

481
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,400
- I can't stand that kind of shoddy work.
- It's like the bad version of both of us.

482
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,360
He doesn't care about his client
and he's not about winning.

483
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,590
He's got even less style than you.

484
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,440
I don't really see how
that's relevant.Like at all.

485
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,190
- Hold on. How did she get this lawyer?
- Her friend Bradley.

486
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,630
- The one who also works at Morello?
- Yeah.

487
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,530
I don't think Bradley's as good
a friend as she thinks he is.

488
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,840
Here's what you're gonna do.

489
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,520
I looked into it. You were right.

490
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,240
Put this together fast.

491
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,520
- I care about Gabby.
- You were right too.

492
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,110
You want me to go with you?

493
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:36,240
I'm sorry,but I got to take
care of this one myself.

494
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:49,580
Rachel?

495
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,330
What are you doing
all the way over here?

496
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:56,060
This guy has the best soft pretzels
in town. Do you want to try it?

497
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:59,050
No,I'm good. Hey,how are
you feeling about the lsats?

498
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:01,110
I was really happy with all
the prep we did yesterday.

499
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:03,260
- I'm really excited for you.
- You're excited for me?

500
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,830
- Why do you even care?
- I was just asking

501
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:10,400
. Well,just stop asking. Look,I came down
here because I just want to be by myself

502
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,750
and I bump into you,and the first thing
you want to talk about is the lsats.

503
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,080
Hey,sorry.

504
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,330
The truth is,I came down
here to clear my head too.

505
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,740
- About what?
- Gabby stone.

506
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,260
The girl who did the insider trading?

507
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,850
She actually suspected that
something was wrong after the trade,

508
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,350
but she didn't do anything about it.

509
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,500
She didn't want to
jeopardize her career.

510
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,950
Now she's gonna be paying for that
mistake for the rest of her life.

511
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,830
Anyway,I'm sorry I ruined your alone
time. I'll see you back at the office.

512
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,200
Let me ask you something,Nick.

513
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,280
- Does Burt Kimball drag his feet paying you too?
- Excuse me?

514
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,800
'Cause in my experience,getting money from
that asshole is like getting blood from a stone.

515
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,190
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yes,you do.

516
00:33:56,190 --> 00:34:00,720
See,after I saw your client
sitting in jail,I got to wondering.

517
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,870
How'd she find you?I'm
gonna call security.

518
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:06,920
Absolutely. See,it turns out that
her friend Bradley recommended you.

519
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,470
Bradley,who's been at Morello
assets for the past seven years.

520
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:13,790
So I checked. You know what I found?

521
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,980
You represented Burt Kimball
in a civil suit 12 years ago.

522
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:24,090
It just so happens you also represented Lunardi
pharmaceuticals in their fda approval proceedings.

523
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,750
That doesn't mean anything.

524
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:30,860
You've seen my relationship with the DOJ.
Want me to point them in your direction?

525
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,110
Or do you want to admit to me
that Burt Kimball's paying you off?

526
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:52,880
Harvey, I don't understand.

527
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,100
I thought all this
business was done with.

528
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,950
It's almost sorted out,Dean. I'm just
here to let you know that Burt's a crook.

529
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,380
- What did you say?
- Harvey.

530
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,440
He used a lawyer to periodically
provide him with insider information.

531
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,400
Once he got this information,

532
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,370
he handed out one tip sheet
different from all the others,

533
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:13,080
so the trader,in this
instance,Gabrielle stone,

534
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,850
would make a trade not knowing that
she was acting on an illegal tip.

535
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,400
It was actually ingenious.

536
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,850
If the trade was ever under suspicion,
even the trader couldn't point to Burt.

537
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,150
- We've heard more than enough,thank you.
- I don't think so.

538
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,880
Miss stone made two mistakes.

539
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,940
One,she made a trade
for more than $9 million.

540
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,970
And the other was not going to the DOJ.

541
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,990
The second the stock
shot up through the roof.

542
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:38,040
- You son of a bitch.
- Harvey,this is a lot to digest.

543
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,270
Well,I'll make it easy for
you,Dean. He's a cancer.

544
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,430
You don't cut him loose,he's
gonna kill your whole company.

545
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:47,370
How dare you walk in here and
accuse me with these things?

546
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,190
I mean,you are my lawyer.

547
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,970
No,Burt,I'm the lawyer for
Morello asset management.

548
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:55,710
As far as the law is concerned,
Dean Morello's my client,not you.

549
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,290
- Dumb son of a bitch.
- Burt,you're fired.

550
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,150
What? Effective immediately.

551
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:04,720
You're gonna fire me? Because of this?

552
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,080
I hope you're happy. 'Cause without
me,this hedge fund's nothing.

553
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,480
I'll be happy when the department of
justice puts your ass in handcuffs.

554
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,920
Enjoy your freedom,Burt,because
they're coming for you.

555
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,130
And since you're a bigger
trophy than Gabrielle stone,

556
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:21,970
you're gonna get a whole
lot more than 11 months.

557
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:29,000
Harvey,I want you to know that
I knew nothing about any of this.

558
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,850
Dean,when I was 13 years old,

559
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:34,870
my little brother was getting
bullied by a kid in the neighborhood.

560
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,290
One day,I confronted the kid's father.

561
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,950
He told me he didn't know anything
about it. You know what his problem was?

562
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,530
It was his goddamn job to know.

563
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,320
Thanks for getting me out.

564
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,500
- We're just sorry we couldn't get you your bonus.
- It wasn't mine to begin with.

565
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,900
- But without it,I don't know how I'm gonna pay you.
- Don't worry about it.

566
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,150
Dean Morello's footing this bill.

567
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,780
You believed in me.

568
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:15,620
I can't tell you how
grateful I am to both of you.

569
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,430
Never doubted you for a second.

570
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,280
Oh,Gabby,I wanted to give you something.

571
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,330
Left it on your desk.

572
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,540
Thank you.

573
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,530
All right,well,I'm
gonna find some water.

574
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:38,270
You don't come back soon, we're
sending out a search party.

575
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:43,100
- You never doubted her for a second?
- I didn't doubt her for a second.

576
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,890
- I doubted her for days.
- Yeah,that's not what you just led her to believe.

577
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,920
People hear what they want to hear.

578
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,520
Oh,I meant to ask you, that big
guy that you got in a fight with,

579
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,280
Mr. t,was he in on this whole thing?

580
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,120
No,he was just a dick.

581
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:06,270
That was the most brilliant portrayal
of king lear I have ever seen.

582
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,990
"Come up between the
dragon and his wrath."

583
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,290
That was... Thank you for
tonight,Jessica,really.

584
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:17,230
- This was nice. This is really,really nice.
- You're welcome,Louis.

585
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:20,450
And,yes,this was-This was really nice.

586
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:26,190
Listen,I just want you to know how much I
appreciate everything that you do for this firm.

587
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:30,080
- I take a lot of pride in my work.
- I know,and you're very good at what you do.

588
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:34,730
Okay,can you just please say
that once in front of Harvey?

589
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,530
Louis,I know you and
Harvey have a rivalry.

590
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,120
And the truth is that,right now,
Harvey is more valuable to the firm.

591
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:52,640
But that doesn't always mean
that he is going to be on top.

592
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:57,980
Because another truth is is that I can't
always count on Harvey to listen to me,

593
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,870
- but I can count on you.
- Yeah. Yes,you can.

594
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:05,640
So you keep doing what you're
doing,Louis, and you're gonna be just fine.

595
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,060
And if he doesn't know it already,

596
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:12,810
I promise Harvey is going to understand
just how valuable you are to me.

597
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:18,620
- You know,next week there's a revival of cats.
- No.

598
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,530
Nice touch. Tickets to the yankee
game. Found 'em on my desk.Can't wait.

599
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,840
- You're welcome.
- Nachos are on you this time.

600
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,120
Oh,those tickets aren't for you
and me. They're for you and Louis.

601
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,990
Sunday the 20th. Did I mention
that I'm busy that night?

602
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:43,630
I know you are. You're busy going
to the yankee game with Louis.

603
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:48,170
Son,your ego's writing checks
that your body can't cash.

604
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:52,140
Oh,see,that's funny,because now I'm
quoting top gun and-Get out of my office.

605
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,810
Very funny. Very funny.

606
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,490
Very funny.

607
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,850
Mike. Hey,you got a second? I
just-I just want to thank you.

608
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,850
- Thank me for what?
- For going out of your way to help me with the lsats.

609
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,560
It's nothing. I'm sure
you'd do the same for me.

610
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,850
I put a lot of pressure
on myself. I always have.

611
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:19,440
You're right. I'm a perfectionist.

612
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,030
- It's okay.
- No,it's not okay.

613
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,990
My dad,he always wanted a son.

614
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,970
Never something that they brought
up. It was just sort of there.

615
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,970
And I never felt like I
was good enough for him.

616
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:35,390
Which is why I don't like to put
myself in positions where I might fail.

617
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:39,300
So I decided to just push the lsats,

618
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,730
give myself a little more time to study.

619
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,980
That's good. That's great. I
think you made the right choice.

620
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,380
Really? Why?

621
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,820
You were the one that's been
pushing me to take them next week.

622
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:53,600
I just meant that I,you know,
support the decision you made.

623
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,470
Why are you suddenly changing your tune?

624
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:58,660
Because if you're not
ready,you're not ready.

625
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:02,970
- Listen,I got to go. I'll see you tomorrow.
- No,that's not why.

626
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:07,120
All that interest in Theresa and then
the other guy didn't show up,but you did.

627
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,520
- You were gonna take the test for me.
- What guy? What are you talking about?

628
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,430
You know exactly what I'm talking
about. You're the test genius,right?

629
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,260
Mike,I could pick up the
phone and find out right now.

630
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,520
Yes,I took the test
for your friend Theresa.

631
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,880
That's the whole reason
you were trying to help me.

632
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,360
- Because you thought if you didn't, you were gonna get caught.
- That's not true.

633
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,040
How am I supposed to believe that?

634
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,930
Honestly,how am I supposed
to believe anything you say

635
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:35,560
when the whole time you were at
Harvard studying to be a lawyer,

636
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,250
you were actually
cheating for other people?

637
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:41,280
- Yes,I was helping people
cheat,okay,but-- - But what?

638
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:51,150
It's not the whole story.
