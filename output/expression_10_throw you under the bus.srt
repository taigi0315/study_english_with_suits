1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
But if you fire me,
then I could tell them
하지만 절 해고하면,

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,830
that you lied about me,
제가 그들에게 말할 수 있어요

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,400
and you'd definitely lose
your license.
당신이 저에 대해 거짓말했다고,

4
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,040
Are you telling me that
그럼 당신은 분명히

5
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:09,570
if I throw you under the bus,
면허를 잃을 거예요.

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,010
you're gonna drag me with you?
지금 절 비난하면,

7
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,040
You put your interests
above mine,
저를 버리면,
