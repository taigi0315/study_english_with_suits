- You did.

120
00:04:38,357 --> 00:04:40,658
- What's my middle name?
- The letter "L."

124
00:04:45,964 --> 00:04:47,832
Because the lease
I read wasn't 300 pages.

125

It was 364.

And I can tell you what's on
any one of those pages,

but I can't tell you that.

136
00:05:07,286 --> 00:05:09,788

to go to Harvard?

Okay. Senior partners,
they buy into the firm.

00:09:00,885 --> 00:09:01,985
They share in the profits,

226

have to put up equity.

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,381
- Huh.
- What?

324
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:50,251
Oh, nothing.
Uh, you know, just six hours,

325
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:53,454
1,500 pages, and I, uh,

326
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,057
I found your mistake.

327
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:57,559
Yeah, you found
the one mistake I made

328
00:12:57,627 --> 00:13:00,396
while drafting those bylaws
a dozen years ago

329
00:13:00,464 --> 00:13:02,064
when I was two years
younger than you.

330
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:03,466
A mistake, by the way,

331
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:05,502
that's gonna help me
get rid of Stensland.

332
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,404
Mistake.

333
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:26,216
Excuse me, Mr. Specter?

334
00:13:26,283 --> 00:13:28,051
I was wondering if you might
need a hand sometime

335
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:29,085
with one of your matters.

336
00:13:29,153 --> 00:13:30,119
Uh, any one.

337
00:13:30,187 --> 00:13:31,554
Well, Allen--

338
00:13:31,622 --> 00:13:32,822
It's Aaron.

339
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,359
I think that says it all,
don't you?

340
00:13:36,426 --> 00:13:38,627
What are you doing?

341
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:40,462
Uh, I'm looking
for a restaurant.

342
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,064
Where did you go
for your rookie dinner?

343
00:13:42,132 --> 00:13:43,699
I came into the league
a sophomore.

344
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:44,933
You better not be
prioritizing that

345
00:13:45,001 --> 00:13:46,167
over McKernon Motors.

346
00:13:46,235 --> 00:13:47,602
I still need something
to stall Stensland.

347
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,371
It's right here.

348
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:51,940
What are you
so irritated about?

349
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:54,375
I spent a day
with a top headhunter I know

350
00:13:54,443 --> 00:13:56,745
who couldn't produce one
legitimate CEO candidate

351
00:13:56,813 --> 00:13:57,880
by Thursday.

352
00:13:57,947 --> 00:13:58,981
What about
that Dominic Barone guy

353
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:00,316
who runs production?

354
00:14:00,383 --> 00:14:01,918
You said he was responsible
for the engines,

355
00:14:01,986 --> 00:14:03,486
and he clearly cares
about the workers.

356
00:14:03,554 --> 00:14:05,288
No, he's not the guy.

357
00:14:05,356 --> 00:14:06,991
Oh, you're scared
you can't convince him

358
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:08,726
because he hates you.
I get it.

359
00:14:08,793 --> 00:14:09,994
Nice try.

360
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:11,329
You know you can't
host your dinner there.

361
00:14:11,396 --> 00:14:13,764
That's a Wachtell, Lipton,
Klein restaurant.

362
00:14:13,832 --> 00:14:16,066
Okay. Fine.

363
00:14:16,134 --> 00:14:17,935
What about this place?

364
00:14:18,003 --> 00:14:20,104
Yeah, that'd be great
if it was 2004.

365
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:21,238
[Sighs] Oh, my God.

366
00:14:21,306 --> 00:14:25,376
Why does any of this matter?
God.

367
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:28,111
You see that guy
over there by the fax?

368
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:32,682
Take a good look.

369
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,184
He's never gonna make partner.

370
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:36,019
Okay. Let me guess.

371
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:38,322
Because he threw
a lousy rookie dinner?

372
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,357
No, because he doesn't get it.

373
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:41,993
Get what?

374
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,163
He doesn't get that doing
good work isn't the whole job.

375
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:46,731
Part of getting it

376
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,533
is that things like the dinner
actually matter,

377
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:50,636
even when
you don't think they do.

378
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:52,071
Look,
you were giving me shit

379
00:14:52,138 --> 00:14:53,339
this morning because
I come and go when I want to.

380
00:14:53,406 --> 00:14:54,640
You know why I can do that?

381
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,242
Because when I got here,
I dominated.

382
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,477
They thought I worked
100 hours a day.

383
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:01,813
Now, no matter
what time I get in,

384
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,116
nobody questions my ability
to get the job done.

385
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:06,618
Get it through your head.

386
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:08,486
First impressions last.

387
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:10,188
You start
behind the eight ball,

388
00:15:10,255 --> 00:15:12,090
you'll never get in front.

389
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,370
- Hey, you busy?
- It's 7:00.

390
00:15:25,438 --> 00:15:27,506
I'm not here
'cause I like the view.

391
00:15:27,574 --> 00:15:28,941
And don't misunderstand me.

392
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:30,809
When I say "the view,"
I'm referring to your face.

393
00:15:30,877 --> 00:15:32,511
That's funny,
because I'm hideous.

394
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,546
- What's up?
- You're a foodie, right?

395
00:15:34,614 --> 00:15:35,647
Why do you say that?

396
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:36,983
Because you're the only person

397
00:15:37,051 --> 00:15:38,451
I've ever seen order
a shrimp, red pepper,

398
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,552
and goat cheese pizza.

399
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,188
Well, right,
but without the pepper,

400
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:42,990
what connects the goat cheese
and the shrimp?

401
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:44,525
I'm a foodie.

402
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:46,328
Okay, so I need your help
finding a restaurant

403
00:15:46,395 --> 00:15:47,429
for the rookie dinner.

404
00:15:47,497 --> 00:15:48,731
Well, that's unfortunate,

405
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:50,266
but I'm swamped,
and I don't have time

406
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,467
to teach you about cuisine.

407
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:52,835
Well, no,
don't make me remind you

408
00:15:52,903 --> 00:15:54,604
that you owe me one.
How's that?

409
00:15:54,671 --> 00:15:56,505
You told Louis I was working
on Harvey's case before his.

410
00:15:56,573 --> 00:15:58,041
Because you told me to.

411
00:15:58,108 --> 00:15:59,676
Well, now I'm telling you
to help me with my dinner.

412
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,777
Mm.

413
00:16:00,844 --> 00:16:02,845
- You-- Okay.
- Good luck with that.

414
00:16:02,913 --> 00:16:05,148
Not gonna help me
with my dinner.

415
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:08,217
Now I'm talking to myself.

416
00:16:10,788 --> 00:16:12,087
Yeah, grammy.
[Knock at door]

417
00:16:12,155 --> 00:16:13,556
No, I told you I was coming.

418
00:16:13,623 --> 00:16:19,528
I'm-- I'm on my way, okay?
Yeah.

419
00:16:19,596 --> 00:16:22,997
Um, 15 minutes.

420
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,299
Okay. Bye.
Hey, what are you--

421
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:27,702
Okay, what was that for?

422
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:28,969
If you cared about me,

423
00:16:29,037 --> 00:16:30,337
you would have told me
what Trevor was up to

424
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:31,305
a long time ago.

425
00:16:31,372 --> 00:16:32,706
I was trying to protect you.

426
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:34,474
How is hiding the fact

427
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,877
that my boyfriend
is selling weed protecting me?

428
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:38,546
You want to know the truth?

429
00:16:38,613 --> 00:16:41,549
Your boyfriend also happens
to be my best friend, all right?

430
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:42,584
I didn't feel
like ratting him out.

431
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:44,152
If you were really his friend,

432
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,988
you wouldn't just stand by
and let him throw his life away.

433
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:47,656
Let him? Let--

434
00:16:47,724 --> 00:16:49,926
I've never let Trevor
do anything. Have you met him?

435
00:16:49,993 --> 00:16:52,495
Trevor listens to you,
and he needs you right now.

436
00:16:52,563 --> 00:16:53,730
Oh, my God.

437
00:16:53,798 --> 00:16:55,532
He is throwing his life away,

438
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:58,134
and you ditched us.

439
00:16:58,202 --> 00:17:01,338
Both.

440
00:17:01,405 --> 00:17:03,773
Like we didn't mean
anything to you.

441
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:10,914
I'm...I'm late.

442
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:34,003
Louis.
What are you doing here?

443
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:36,239
Hi.
Uh, Stensland called.

444
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:38,842
And apparently the diligence
wasn't proceeding apace.

445
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:40,043
He called you?

446
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:40,877
Yeah, he called me,
I called him,

447
00:17:40,945 --> 00:17:42,046
what's the difference?

448
00:17:42,113 --> 00:17:42,946
The paperwork
was taking too long,

449
00:17:43,014 --> 00:17:44,381
and I got it done.

450
00:17:44,449 --> 00:17:46,551
I suggest you stay
the hell away from my client.

451
00:17:46,618 --> 00:17:49,121
Harvey.
Glad you could make it.

452
00:17:49,188 --> 00:17:50,255
We were about
to sign the papers.

453
00:17:50,323 --> 00:17:51,123
I got word back at the office.

454
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,291
I just came to see how Louis

455
00:17:52,358 --> 00:17:54,893
was getting around the bylaws.

456
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:56,695
I...Don't know.

457
00:17:56,762 --> 00:17:59,131
Ah...

458
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:00,165
I'm at somewhat of a loss.

459
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:01,567
Robert, I'm sorry.

460
00:18:01,634 --> 00:18:03,402
This is what was holding up
your due diligence.

461
00:18:03,469 --> 00:18:05,237
Technically,
you're still interim CEO

462
00:18:05,304 --> 00:18:07,239
until the board
votes you in on Thursday.

463
00:18:07,306 --> 00:18:08,507
If protocol isn't followed,

464
00:18:08,574 --> 00:18:10,175
it leaves you with huge
litigation exposure.

465
00:18:10,243 --> 00:18:11,510
That's right.

466
00:18:11,578 --> 00:18:14,713
Well, I imagine
we should hold off, then.

467
00:18:14,781 --> 00:18:16,715
Please don't blame Louis.
It's my fault.

468
00:18:16,783 --> 00:18:19,585
We usually have senior partners
oversee transactions like this

469
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:21,486
because junior partners,
they tend to miss things.

470
00:18:21,554 --> 00:18:22,488
See you Thursday?

471
00:18:22,555 --> 00:18:24,290
One second.

472
00:18:24,357 --> 00:18:25,624
Uh, just so you know,

473
00:18:25,692 --> 00:18:27,493
you were a junior partner
until recently.

474
00:18:27,561 --> 00:18:29,428
There's a reason
I'm not anymore.

475
00:18:29,496 --> 00:18:31,330
Okay. Take it easy.

476
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:33,966
So what if you took a trip
to Russia with another man?

477
00:18:34,034 --> 00:18:36,101
I mean, that was before
you met grandpa Jimmy, right?

478
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:38,336
He didn't care
it was before I met him.

479
00:18:38,404 --> 00:18:39,838
Never shut up about it.

480
00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:41,740
So what was
this other guy's name?

481
00:18:41,808 --> 00:18:43,543
Gregory mind your own business.

482
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,444
Ooh.

483
00:18:45,512 --> 00:18:47,479
So, Michael, this has been fun.

484
00:18:47,547 --> 00:18:49,348
Now why don't you stop
beating around the bush

485
00:18:49,415 --> 00:18:54,554
and tell me what's going on.

486
00:18:54,621 --> 00:18:56,856
Trevor.

487
00:18:56,924 --> 00:18:58,558
It's Trevor.
It's always Trevor.

488
00:18:58,626 --> 00:19:00,761
He's gotten himself
into some really bad...

489
00:19:00,828 --> 00:19:04,064
Stuff, and I think he needs
my help to get out of it,

490
00:19:04,132 --> 00:19:06,400
but I've been under
so much pressure,

491
00:19:06,468 --> 00:19:08,469
and I know you've always told
me to be there for people...

492
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:10,070
No, no, listen to me.

493
00:19:10,138 --> 00:19:12,139
Screw Trevor.
What?

494
00:19:12,207 --> 00:19:13,307
You're moving forward,

495
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,975
and he'll do whatever he can

496
00:19:15,043 --> 00:19:16,443
to keep you where you are.

497
00:19:16,511 --> 00:19:17,444
Yeah, but...

498
00:19:17,512 --> 00:19:18,512
But no buts.

499
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,047
That kid is an anchor.

500
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:23,884
You need to cut him loose.

501
00:19:23,951 --> 00:19:27,086
- Whoa.
- You owe me 50 bucks.

502
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:40,199
What's going on
with Robert Stensland?

503
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:41,633
What did Louis tell you?

504
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:44,103
You're not dealing with Louis.
You're dealing with me.

505
00:19:44,171 --> 00:19:45,337
What are you hiding?

506
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:46,538
Nothing.
I looked through the bylaws

507
00:19:46,606 --> 00:19:48,173
and precluded
potential litigation.

508
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:51,109
You looked at the bylaws
for a tactical reason,

509
00:19:51,177 --> 00:19:52,210
and I want to know what it is.

510
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,217
I want him out.

511
00:19:59,284 --> 00:20:01,485
That is not your call.
You are an attorney.

512
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:04,087
This is the internal business
of McKernon Motors.

513
00:20:04,155 --> 00:20:05,856
Look, McKernon had a plan,

514
00:20:05,924 --> 00:20:07,491
and I didn't spend
a decade shaping it

515
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:08,825
to let this fool throw it away.

516
00:20:08,893 --> 00:20:10,126
McKernon is dead.

517
00:20:10,194 --> 00:20:11,394
So what?
Doesn't mean the plan's no good.

518
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:13,262
You fail, we'll get fired.

519
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,597
He moves overseas,

520
00:20:14,665 --> 00:20:16,366
our billables ll be gone
in five years, anyway.

521
00:20:16,434 --> 00:20:18,035
Better five years than nothing.

522
00:20:18,103 --> 00:20:19,637
You know what?
That's Stensland's attitude,

523
00:20:19,704 --> 00:20:21,973
and it's a losing one.

524
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,310
Harvey, I don't think
you have any business

525
00:20:25,378 --> 00:20:27,279
telling that man
how to run his company,

526
00:20:27,347 --> 00:20:29,148
but I know you don't
have any business

527
00:20:29,216 --> 00:20:30,716
telling me how to run mine.

528
00:20:30,784 --> 00:20:32,352
You are a senior partner.

529
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:34,454
You are not
a gunslinger anymore.

530
00:20:34,522 --> 00:20:37,323
Back off Stensland
and close the deal.

531
00:20:50,495 --> 00:20:51,796
I need you to prepare

532
00:20:51,864 --> 00:20:53,865
the draft CEO candidate speech
for Thursday.

533
00:20:53,932 --> 00:20:55,200
Well, I thought you
were supposed to back off.

534
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:56,534
Yeah, I'm supposed to do
a lot of things.

535
00:20:56,602 --> 00:20:58,437
I'll call you with the plan
on my way back.

536
00:20:58,505 --> 00:20:59,672
From where?

537
00:20:59,739 --> 00:21:01,107
From convincing
the man who hates me

538
00:21:01,174 --> 00:21:03,175
to do what I say.
Oh, right.

539
00:21:03,243 --> 00:21:05,644
You mean the guy I suggested
you go to in the first place.

540
00:21:05,712 --> 00:21:06,979
Do you remember that whole

541

getting it thing
I was talking to you about?

542
00:21:08,048 --> 00:21:09,515
What, I can't even gloat?

543
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,083
Gloating's fine.
You just have to not suck at it.

544
00:21:12,151 --> 00:21:15,120
Okay.
Thank you. So much.

545

That hurt.

546
00:21:22,428 --> 00:21:23,662
Hey, Ross.

547
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,130
You left your search
for the rookie dinner

548
00:21:25,198 --> 00:21:26,131
on your computer.

549

Why don't you just save time

550
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,767
and take us to Friday's?

551

Ooh, ooh, somebody's mad.

Devon, looking at my computer

553
00:21:32,338 --> 00:21:34,271
is a violation of exactly seven

hostile workplace
environment statutes.

555

What are you gonna do?
Sue me?

556
00:21:38,109 --> 00:21:39,309
No.
No, no, no.

557
00:21:39,377 --> 00:21:40,677
I'm just gonna use it
as legal cover

558

if I decide to kick your ass.

Harvey,
what are you doing here?

Our contract's good
for two more years.

I need a word.
In private.

563
00:22:00,063 --> 00:22:01,230
Excuse me, bill.

564
00:22:01,297 --> 00:22:02,998
Make it fast,
'cause this is a place

565

where people actually
work for a living.

566
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:06,035
Well, keep in mind
people are watching.

Just try to keep
your expression neutral.

568

You know, they don't teach

deceptive tactics
where I come from.

570
00:22:10,474 --> 00:22:11,341
Then you're gonna learn
under fire.

What? Why?

For money.

He's got a buyer for the land
under the factory.

575

Why are you coming to me?

576
00:22:20,553 --> 00:22:22,521
Because the only way
to stop him

577
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:24,289
is for you
to challenge him as CEO.

578
00:22:24,357 --> 00:22:25,490
What?
Are you crazy?

579
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:26,758
You've got a management title.

580
00:22:26,826 --> 00:22:28,093
That I choose
not to identify with.

'cause I have no taste
for boardroom politics.

You've been here since day one.

inside out.

How many people
did you go to before me?

589
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,407
- Seven.
- Right.

590
00:22:41,475 --> 00:22:43,543
I never said
you were my prom queen.

Look, I want to win, okay?

592
00:22:45,045 --> 00:22:46,479
I went to those other people

593
00:22:46,546 --> 00:22:48,147
because they were better
suited to get past the board,

594
00:22:48,215 --> 00:22:49,949
not better suited for the job.

595
00:22:50,017 --> 00:22:52,118
Those are the facts
whether you like it or not.

596
00:22:52,186 --> 00:22:53,152
And why should I trust you?

597
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,487
Because if you don't,

598
00:22:54,555 --> 00:22:56,723
there aren't any jobs
left to negotiate over.

599

what you're saying.

They're just platitudes
that don't mean anything.

610

Yes, they do.
Synergistic alliances

611
00:23:44,576 --> 00:23:46,276

Hey, can I ask you something?

630
00:24:32,656 --> 00:24:36,960
What's your engine design
philosophy?

631
00:24:37,028 --> 00:24:39,296
Perfectly balanced
power and durability.

632
00:24:39,364 --> 00:24:43,333
Okay. Why don't you favor
power like Bronson does?

633
00:24:43,401 --> 00:24:45,335
Because drivers are limited
to eight engines a season,

Well, so you would
stack your engines

up against Bronson's, then?

Why?

00:24:59,715 --> 00:25:00,781
to the day they're born.

644
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:02,083
And that's why people buy them.

645
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,584
Goddamn right.

646
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:05,686
And that's the speech
you're gonna give.

647

[Clears throat]

648
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:20,100
Good lawyer, bad lawyer, baby.

649
00:25:20,168 --> 00:25:22,070
Worked like a charm.

650
00:25:22,137 --> 00:25:24,672
Come on.
You know you want it.

651
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,508
There it is.
Told you.

652
00:25:26,576 --> 00:25:27,642
Someone doesn't like you,

653
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,977
you use it against them.

654
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:30,246
Or, in this case, for them.

<i>I didn't do this for Dominic.</i>

I did it
to get rid of Stensland.

657
00:25:33,717 --> 00:25:36,753
Wow. Have you ever considered
writing for hallmark?

658
00:25:36,821 --> 00:25:39,256
Many times. Yeah.

659
00:25:39,324 --> 00:25:42,126
Congrats.

660
00:25:42,193 --> 00:25:44,628
Looking good.

661
00:25:57,174 --> 00:25:58,074
Hey.

662
00:25:58,142 --> 00:25:59,275
I said don't be late.

663
00:25:59,343 --> 00:26:01,344
Late? I'm not late.

664
00:26:01,412 --> 00:26:03,213
When you host your dinner here,

665
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,682
not being late means getting
here a half hour early.

666
00:26:05,749 --> 00:26:08,652
Aha. So what made you
change your mind?

667
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:11,654
The food items are samples
to help you select your menu,

668
00:26:11,722 --> 00:26:15,959
so since I could never really
afford to eat here myself...

669
00:26:16,026 --> 00:26:17,527
Mm.

670
00:26:17,595 --> 00:26:18,762
Mm.

671
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:20,496
Okay, start there.

672
00:26:20,564 --> 00:26:21,564
- Try that?
- Yes.

673
00:26:21,632 --> 00:26:22,531
It looks kind of funny.

So does an egg roll.

675
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:24,800
I don't accept that premise.

00:26:24,868 --> 00:26:26,669
You want my help or not?

677
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:35,143
Ugh. What is that?

678
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,344
Squid.

679
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:40,213
I-- I think
it's still moving.

680
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:44,183
That's what I'm talking about.

681
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:45,552
Mm.

682
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,787
I don't get it.

683
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,722
How do you have no appreciation
for fine food?

684
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,659
Mm. We didn't have a lot
of money growing up.

685
00:26:51,727 --> 00:26:53,261
I don't know.

686
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:55,697
I guess I'm just comfortable
with what I'm comfortable with.

687
00:26:55,765 --> 00:26:57,633
That is the exact
opposite of me.

688
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,969
I've-- I've always
loved new experiences.

689
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,503
And your parents?

690
00:27:01,571 --> 00:27:03,039
They're loaded.

691
00:27:03,106 --> 00:27:06,676
Mm. So then what do you need
a free meal for?

692
00:27:06,743 --> 00:27:08,878
I want to live on what I make.

693
00:27:08,945 --> 00:27:10,412
Mm.

694
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,781
- What?
- Nothing.

695
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:14,716
I was just thinking about
Dominic for a second.

696
00:27:14,784 --> 00:27:17,919
And then I realized
this is the first time in weeks

697
00:27:17,986 --> 00:27:19,520
that I haven't been
thinking about work.

698
00:27:19,588 --> 00:27:21,422
That's what new
experiences do for you.

699
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:25,559
Being a foodie doesn't mean
only liking fancy food.

700
00:27:25,626 --> 00:27:27,261
Means having
the courage to try it.

701
00:27:27,328 --> 00:27:29,429
And then you get to serve
what you like.

702
00:27:29,497 --> 00:27:31,164
Except strawberries, peanuts,

703
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,366
gluten, and chicken.

704
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:33,733
Okay, why not those things?

705
00:27:33,801 --> 00:27:35,435
Because Louis is an asshole.

706
00:27:35,502 --> 00:27:37,604
If you can't serve things
just 'cause Louis is an asshole,

707
00:27:37,672 --> 00:27:40,040
you're not gonna have
that many choices.

708
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:41,041

you talked to him,

Yeah.

about us talking.

in the first place.

You could make something
of yourself.

Is that what
you came here to tell me?

you don't help me out, okay?

Okay.

But the least you could do
is be honest with Jenny.

That's what this is all about.

You're taking a risk on him?

He's scared out of his mind.

because you convinced him to.
So?

So maybe some words
of encouragement.

771
00:30:31,806 --> 00:30:33,407
The best way to help Dominic

772
00:30:33,475 --> 00:30:35,243
is not to let him
second guess himself.

The most important asset
an attorney has

774

is his ability
to always be self-assured.

Okay.
Here's what's gonna happen.

776

It's standard for me
to prep the board

When I tell you to.
Let's go.

780
00:30:54,264 --> 00:30:56,064
I suggested to Stensland
you be there

to convince the board
the production won't be hurt

by an overseas move.

783
00:30:59,168 --> 00:31:00,501
It helps your credibility

that he brought you here,

785
00:31:01,937 --> 00:31:04,405
and it'll hurt his when
you challenge him for CEO.

[Clears throat]

Just remember,
you know your stuff.

789

Excuse me?

It was the delay
in the due diligence.

It just didn't smell right.

799
00:31:36,473 --> 00:31:38,006
So the only thing it could be

800

was that you were going after
my CEO appointment.

rights to move a board meeting,

Try the croissant, gentlemen.

808
00:32:00,028 --> 00:32:02,163
Marmalade's fantastic.

809
00:32:12,175 --> 00:32:13,576
What are we gonna do?

810
00:32:13,644 --> 00:32:15,145
You're gonna go through
those bylaws again,

811
00:32:15,213 --> 00:32:16,413
and see if there isn't
another way

812
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,681
we can stop this sale.

813
00:32:17,749 --> 00:32:18,682
I'm talking about Dominic.

814
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,984
He just lost his job.

815
00:32:20,052 --> 00:32:22,019
He's a grown man.
He made a decision.

816
00:32:22,087 --> 00:32:23,655
[Sighs]
Because you convinced him to.

817
00:32:23,722 --> 00:32:24,923
Based on your idea,

818
00:32:24,991 --> 00:32:26,692
which I recall
you pushed on me at the time.

819
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:28,793
Because I thought
it would work at the time.

820
00:32:28,861 --> 00:32:29,894
Well, it didn't. What do you
want me to do about it?

821
00:32:29,962 --> 00:32:32,163
Help him.

822
00:32:32,231 --> 00:32:33,431
He's not dying.
He lost his job.

823
00:32:33,499 --> 00:32:34,833
He has to look for another one.

824
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,168
Which, if he hadn't chosen

825
00:32:36,235 --> 00:32:37,235
to fight for his company
in the first place,

826
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:38,337
would have happened anyway.

827
00:32:38,404 --> 00:32:39,905
Now, show me that you get it,

828
00:32:39,973 --> 00:32:41,473
go back through
those bylaws again,

829
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:44,009
and see if you missed anything.
Okay?

830
00:32:47,014 --> 00:32:48,948
So this is what happens
when you promote the wrong guy

831
00:32:49,015 --> 00:32:50,382
to senior partner.

832
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,784
If you hadn't gone
to Stensland behind my back,

833
00:32:51,851 --> 00:32:53,719
this wouldn't have happened.
You don't know that.

834
00:32:53,786 --> 00:32:55,354
And I'm a member of this firm
just as much of you.

835
00:32:55,422 --> 00:32:56,522
Oh, I think we both agree
that you're a member.

836
00:32:56,589 --> 00:32:58,724
For your information,
I didn't even--

837
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:01,093
Louis.
Harvey, eye on the ball.

838
00:33:01,161 --> 00:33:04,029
The issue here is you tried
to torpedo a client--

839
00:33:04,097 --> 00:33:06,431
The client is McKernon Motors,
not Stensland.

840
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:07,699
You didn't let me finish.

841
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:10,135
Without my consent.

842
00:33:10,203 --> 00:33:12,871
That trumps
the "who's the client" part.

843
00:33:12,939 --> 00:33:15,841
Louis, go to Stensland,
repair the relationship.

844
00:33:15,908 --> 00:33:18,410
Say what you have to.
Call it a misunderstanding.

845
00:33:18,478 --> 00:33:21,713
Promise Harvey
is no longer involved.

846
00:33:21,781 --> 00:33:23,915
Consider it done.

847
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:28,920
Wait a second.

848
00:33:28,988 --> 00:33:31,089
Louis didn't go to Stensland
behind my back.

849
00:33:31,156 --> 00:33:33,825
You send him there
to hedge your bets.

850
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:38,062
Either stensland's out
and we double our billings,

851
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:39,997
or you have plausible
deniability,

852
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:42,332
and he stays with the firm.

853
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,235
Wow. Am I smart enough
to do that?

854
00:33:46,303 --> 00:33:47,703
If I win, I look great.

855
00:33:47,771 --> 00:33:50,272
If Louis wins, he looks great.

856
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,976
Either way...
You look great.

857
00:33:54,044 --> 00:33:56,646
You mean the firm looks great.

858
00:33:56,713 --> 00:33:58,448
Harvey, what I've been trying
to get into your head

859
00:33:58,515 --> 00:34:00,316
is that you bought in.

860
00:34:00,383 --> 00:34:02,418
You are the firm.

861
00:34:05,054 --> 00:34:06,755
That's it.

862
00:34:09,693 --> 00:34:11,060
Mike, follow me.

863
00:34:11,128 --> 00:34:12,662
I need you
to go talk to Dominic.

864
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:15,465
What? Why?
Stensland's already CEO.

865
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:17,634
That won't matter
if we just buy the damn company.

866
00:34:17,702 --> 00:34:21,873
What?

867
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,277
Why are you still working?

868
00:34:26,345 --> 00:34:27,945
It's one of my creations.

869
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:30,915
I'm not leaving it unfinished.

870
00:34:30,982 --> 00:34:33,284
What the hell do you want?

871
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:35,385
I'd be happy to tell you
if you put that wrench down.

872
00:34:35,453 --> 00:34:36,519
Yeah, you're quick
with the jokes.

873
00:34:36,587 --> 00:34:39,155
I'm the guy who just got fired.

874
00:34:39,223 --> 00:34:42,425
[Sighs]
You're right. I'm sorry.

875
00:34:42,492 --> 00:34:44,427
What would you say
if I told you

876
00:34:44,494 --> 00:34:46,829
we could get your job back
and stick it to Stensland.

877
00:34:46,897 --> 00:34:48,698
I'm done with Harvey
and his plans, yeah?

878
00:34:48,766 --> 00:34:50,299
You were there.
We got fired too.

879
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:51,768
You and Harvey still have jobs?

880
00:34:51,836 --> 00:34:55,105
He doesn't care
about anybody but himself,

881
00:34:55,173 --> 00:34:56,707
including you, Mike.

882
00:34:56,775 --> 00:35:00,878
Yeah.
You're probably right.

883
00:35:00,946 --> 00:35:04,349
But he did stick his neck out
to keep your company here,

884
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:07,185
and he does have an idea
that requires your help,

885
00:35:07,253 --> 00:35:10,321
so you can stay here
and call him an asshole,

886
00:35:10,389 --> 00:35:12,723
or you can come with me
and we can help him.

887
00:35:16,928 --> 00:35:19,396
Give me my goddamn shirt.

888
00:35:33,018 --> 00:35:34,652
You know,
it goes from 0 to 60--

889
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,289
In the blink of an eye.

890
00:35:39,357 --> 00:35:41,925
Did you bring me down here
to tell me I can drive this?

891
00:35:41,993 --> 00:35:43,094
Better.

892
00:35:43,161 --> 00:35:46,029
For $250 million,
you can own it.

893
00:35:46,097 --> 00:35:48,165
McKernon Motors is for sale?

894
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:49,934
If we act fast.

895
00:35:50,002 --> 00:35:51,302
I'll need
to see the financials.

896
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,837
You put together
a letter of intent,

897
00:35:52,905 --> 00:35:54,206
they'll get you the financials.

898
00:35:54,274 --> 00:35:57,076
You know, their real asset
is engine quality.

899
00:35:57,144 --> 00:35:58,711
I don't want
to just buy the name.

900
00:35:58,779 --> 00:36:00,280
Speak of the devil.

901
00:36:00,348 --> 00:36:02,549
Laurence, I'd like you
to meet the man responsible

902
00:36:02,617 --> 00:36:04,284
for every McKernon Motors
engine ever built.

903
00:36:04,352 --> 00:36:06,019
Wow. Dominic Barone.
Very nice to meet you.

904
00:36:06,087 --> 00:36:07,487
Good to meet you.

905
00:36:07,555 --> 00:36:09,356
I'd like to show you something
if you have a minute.

906
00:36:09,423 --> 00:36:12,459
Absolutely.

907
00:36:12,526 --> 00:36:14,527
So how do we get an offer
to the board

908
00:36:14,595 --> 00:36:17,330
before they vote to ratify
the deal tomorrow?

909
00:36:17,398 --> 00:36:18,932
You're gonna
go through those bylaws,

910
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:20,400
and you're gonna
figure something out.

911
00:36:20,468 --> 00:36:22,235
I don't have to look through
them to figure it out,

912
00:36:22,302 --> 00:36:23,202
because I just did.

913
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,537
Well, what took you so long?

914
00:36:24,605 --> 00:36:27,207
You trying to look like me?

915
00:36:32,146 --> 00:36:33,714
Each of you have 24 hours

916
00:36:33,782 --> 00:36:35,383
to review the documents
in front of you,

917
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,951
so at this time...

918
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:38,352
Uh, excuse me.
Excuse me.

919
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,588
What is he doing here?

920
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,057
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna take care of this.

921
00:36:42,124 --> 00:36:43,458
No, no, I will.

922
00:36:43,526 --> 00:36:45,593
You gentlemen have no right
to attend this meeting.

923
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,894
Actually, we do.

924
00:36:46,962 --> 00:36:49,396
The bylaw states
that any original employee

925
00:36:49,464 --> 00:36:50,697
has the right
to petition the board

926
00:36:50,765 --> 00:36:52,299
any time they meet.

927
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:54,968
Dominic Barone
has assigned that right to me.

928
00:36:55,035 --> 00:36:56,536
He was fired.

929
00:36:56,603 --> 00:36:58,070
He no longer has that right.

930
00:36:58,138 --> 00:37:00,640
Per section 17-5, point "C,"

931
00:37:00,707 --> 00:37:02,308
Dominic wasn't given
three days' notice,

932
00:37:02,376 --> 00:37:04,844
so technically he wasn't fired.

933
00:37:04,912 --> 00:37:06,546
Which is why
I do have the right

934
00:37:06,614 --> 00:37:08,649
to urge the board
to accept the offer

935
00:37:08,716 --> 00:37:10,517
for the purchase
of McKernon Motors.

936
00:37:10,585 --> 00:37:12,653
Now, I can tell you
that this offer

937
00:37:12,721 --> 00:37:14,856
will keep manufacturing here
and save jobs

938
00:37:14,923 --> 00:37:16,891
while retaining
the flagship engine

939
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:18,393
that put this company
on the map,

940
00:37:18,461 --> 00:37:20,762
but I don't have to,
because it happens to be

941
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,331
for way more goddamn money

942
00:37:22,398 --> 00:37:25,533
than the one
in front of you right now.

943
00:37:25,601 --> 00:37:28,169
Hey, Bob.
How are ya?

944
00:37:30,338 --> 00:37:32,006
It's funny
how you held out on me

945
00:37:32,073 --> 00:37:33,707
on that proper
notice exception.

946
00:37:33,775 --> 00:37:34,708
I didn't hold out.

947
00:37:34,776 --> 00:37:36,243
I made that up on the spot.

948
00:37:36,311 --> 00:37:37,778
Really? On the spot?

949
00:37:37,846 --> 00:37:39,313
Remember that
getting it stuff--

950
00:37:39,381 --> 00:37:40,714
I know, right?
I'm getting it.

951
00:37:40,782 --> 00:37:43,250
Well, I was gonna say that,
but now you ruined it.

952
00:37:43,317 --> 00:37:45,919
That's one thing
you definitely get.

953
00:37:45,987 --> 00:37:48,622
How to ruin it.

954
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,923
How to ruin it?

955
00:37:49,991 --> 00:37:53,360
I heard that.

956
00:38:02,371 --> 00:38:04,572
[Clears throat]

957
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,275
I have to admit,
you don't suck.

958
00:38:07,343 --> 00:38:09,545
I wish I could say
the same for you.

959
00:38:12,549 --> 00:38:14,851
Time to pay the Piper.

960
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,486
Just so you know,
I took the liberty

961
00:38:16,554 --> 00:38:19,056
of ordering some
really expensive wines.

962
00:38:19,123 --> 00:38:20,691
Hope that's okay.

963
00:38:23,128 --> 00:38:24,928
[Nervous laugh]

964
00:38:32,003 --> 00:38:34,205
Sorry, sir, but the check's
been paid for in full

965
00:38:34,273 --> 00:38:36,107
