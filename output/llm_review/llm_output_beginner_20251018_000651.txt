Original Subtitle Chunk:
--------------------------------------------------
1. [00:44:08.770000-00:44:10.140000] but if you keep playing footsie
2. [00:44:10.210000-00:44:11.740000] instead of finding me
an argument,
3. [00:44:11.810000-00:44:13.440000] the client's gonna lose.
4. [00:44:13.510000-00:44:15.010000] I don't want to lose.
5. [00:44:15.080000-00:44:17.250000] Ugh.
6. [00:44:17.320000-00:44:20.720000] Look, it's no use.
7. [00:44:20.790000-00:44:23.120000] Okay, their investigation's
by the book.
8. [00:44:23.190000-00:44:24.460000] We look like the bad guys
coming in,
9. [00:44:24.520000-00:44:25.860000] putting them under duress.
10. [00:44:25.920000-00:44:27.660000] What did you just say?
11. [00:44:27.730000-00:44:29.030000] I said we look
like the bad guys.
12. [00:44:29.090000-00:44:30.930000] No, you said
13. [00:44:31-00:44:32.500000] they did it by the book
14. [00:44:32.560000-00:44:34.200000] and we're putting them
under duress.
15. [00:44:34.270000-00:44:38.940000] Yeah.
16. [00:44:39.010000-00:44:41.610000] - Look.
- Hmm.
17. [00:44:41.670000-00:44:43.510000] This is good.
We're gonna have some fun.
18. [00:44:43.580000-00:44:46.450000] We?
I get to go?
19. [00:44:46.510000-00:44:47.910000] You didn't think
I'd let you come along?
20. [00:44:47.980000-00:44:49.980000] - No.
- Good instinct. I wasn't.
21. [00:44:50.050000-00:44:51.520000] But then I thought
it'd be cruel
22. [00:44:51.590000-00:44:53.250000] not to let you witness
my greatness.
23. [00:44:53.320000-00:44:55.560000] - Okay, can I go get my bag?
- No.
24. [00:44:55.620000-00:44:57.430000] - You're a true giver.
- Other side.
25. [00:44:57.490000-00:45:00.530000] Okay.
26. [00:45:00.600000-00:45:02.600000] Your honor, this case
should be thrown out.
27. [00:45:02.660000-00:45:04.430000] Other than her story,
the plaintiff doesn't have
28. [00:45:04.500000-00:45:06.370000] one piece of evidence.
29. [00:45:06.440000-00:45:08.500000] Because the evidence lies
within their personnel files,
30. [00:45:08.570000-00:45:11.140000] which they're conveniently
refusing to hand over.
31. [00:45:11.210000-00:45:13.010000] Those files contain
sensitive information.
32. [00:45:13.080000-00:45:14.640000] He's fishing at the expense
33. [00:45:14.710000-00:45:16.250000] of our employees' right
to privacy.
34. [00:45:16.310000-00:45:18.610000] Please.
They don't give a rat's ass
35. [00:45:18.680000-00:45:20.550000] about his employees' right
to privacy.
36. [00:45:20.620000-00:45:23.590000] Sorry, that's actually unfair
to rats' asses.
37. [00:45:23.650000-00:45:25.590000] Your honor, Mr. Specter's
claim that we don't care
38. [00:45:25.660000-00:45:27.690000] about our employees,
though belittling,
39. [00:45:27.760000-00:45:30.190000] doesn't carry any weight
as a rule of law.
40. [00:45:30.260000-00:45:32.600000] True, but what does carry
weight is that an investigation
41. [00:45:32.660000-00:45:34.330000] of sexual harassment
must be conducted
42. [00:45:34.400000-00:45:35.630000] without any duress.
43. [00:45:35.700000-00:45:36.930000] Your point?
44. [00:45:37-00:45:38.930000] The investigator
and every person
45. [00:45:39-00:45:41] being interviewed
answers to the ceo
46. [00:45:41.070000-00:45:42.400000] they're investigating.
47. [00:45:42.470000-00:45:47.210000] That is the definition
of duress.
48. [00:45:47.280000-00:45:48.510000] It'd be as if your bailiff
49. [00:45:48.580000-00:45:50.910000] accused you of sexual harassment
50. [00:45:50.980000-00:45:52.450000] and you assigned
your stenographer
51. [00:45:52.520000-00:45:54.720000] to investigate.
52. [00:45:54.790000-00:45:56.190000] Now how likely would it be
53. [00:45:56.250000-00:45:58.290000] that this investigation
yielded any fruit?
54. [00:45:58.360000-00:46:01.390000] You honestly think
I would harass Herman?
55. [00:46:01.460000-00:46:02.830000] Well, I don't know, your honor.
56. [00:46:02.890000-00:46:04.590000] Some people have a thing
for the uniform.
57. [00:46:04.660000-00:46:07.660000] Ugh. I'd like to think
Herman would come to me
58. [00:46:07.730000-00:46:09.930000] before it even got
to an investigation.
59. [00:46:11.700000-00:46:14.500000] I saw that.
That should be stricken.
60. [00:46:14.570000-00:46:16.870000] But what if Herman did come
to you, your honor?
61. [00:46:16.940000-00:46:18.780000] And you betrayed his trust
62. [00:46:18.840000-00:46:20.980000] by firing him
under false pretenses?
63. [00:46:21.050000-00:46:22.810000] You really think
that little of me?
64. [00:46:22.880000-00:46:26.220000] I wouldn't trust you
as far as I could throw you.
65. [00:46:26.280000-00:46:28.390000] Your honor.
66. [00:46:28.450000-00:46:30.920000] Hand over the files...
67. [00:46:30.990000-00:46:32.390000] - Oh--
- Today.
68. [00:46:32.460000-00:46:34.290000] That's it.
69. [00:46:34.360000-00:46:38.760000] Herman, I'd like to speak
to you in chambers.
70. [00:46:40.500000-00:46:41.530000] That was awesome.
71. [00:46:41.600000-00:46:42.600000] It was your argument.
72. [00:46:42.670000-00:46:44.100000] I just framed it in a way
73. [00:46:44.170000-00:46:45.570000] that humanized the situation
74. [00:46:45.640000-00:46:47.110000] and brightened
all of our afternoons.
75. [00:46:47.170000-00:46:48.740000] I feel like Michael corleone
in that scene
76. [00:46:48.810000-00:46:50.810000] where that fat guy teaches him
how to shoot that gun.
77. [00:46:50.880000-00:46:51.910000] Are you saying
that I'm the fat guy?
78. [00:46:51.980000-00:46:53.350000] 'Cause I'm not the fat guy.
79. [00:46:53.410000-00:46:55.950000] Mm.
80. [00:46:56.020000-00:46:57.620000] You know what his name was?
81. [00:46:57.690000-00:46:59.190000] - Yeah.
- Cordoza.
82. [00:46:59.260000-00:47:00.620000] - Clemenza.
- I knew that.
83. [00:47:00.690000-00:47:01.990000] I was just testing
to see if you knew it.
84. [00:47:02.060000-00:47:04.590000] I knew that you knew
that I knew.
85. [00:47:11.770000-00:47:18.040000] ♪ ♪
86. [00:47:18.110000-00:47:21.310000] Train wreck.
87. [00:47:21.380000-00:47:22.640000] Hey, I'm looking
88. [00:47:22.710000-00:47:23.980000] for rene.
89. [00:47:24.050000-00:47:25.810000] I'm rene.
I'm sorry.
90. [00:47:25.880000-00:47:29.520000] We don't sell skinny jeans
at this location.
91. [00:47:29.580000-00:47:32.850000] Did Harvey tell you
I was coming, or...?
92. [00:47:32.920000-00:47:34.750000] Harvey Specter sent you?
93. [00:47:34.820000-00:47:36.820000] That's another story.
94. [00:47:36.890000-00:47:38.360000] Do you know your inseam?
95. [00:47:38.430000-00:47:40.990000] I don't.
It's probably a medium.
96. [00:47:41.060000-00:47:44] Oh. Why don't you browse
for a while?
97. [00:47:44.070000-00:47:45.130000] These are the most exclusive,
98. [00:47:45.200000-00:47:46.230000] and we move down in price
99. [00:47:46.300000-00:47:50.040000] as you head to the door.
100. [00:47:50.110000-00:47:53.110000] Oh.
Okay.
101. [00:47:56.650000-00:47:58.780000] Large?
102. [00:47:58.850000-00:48:02.480000] That's not how it works.
103. [00:48:02.550000-00:48:04.890000] Huh.
104. [00:48:15.300000-00:48:18.100000] So Trevor's getting you to do
his dirty work for him, huh?
105. [00:48:18.170000-00:48:20.800000] All I know is you
aren't talking to each other.
106. [00:48:20.870000-00:48:21.800000] I miss you.
107. [00:48:21.870000-00:48:23.140000] I want things
108. [00:48:23.200000-00:48:24.570000] to go back
to the way they were.
109. [00:48:24.640000-00:48:26.970000] I miss you too.
But...
110. [00:48:27.040000-00:48:28.640000] I'm not sure
things are ever going back
111. [00:48:28.710000-00:48:29.840000] to the way they were.
112. [00:48:29.910000-00:48:32.480000] I gotta go.
113. [00:48:32.550000-00:48:34.050000] What did he say?
114. [00:48:34.120000-00:48:35.550000] He said things
aren't ever going back
115. [00:48:35.620000-00:48:38.220000] to the way they were.
116. [00:48:38.290000-00:48:40.020000] What did you do?
117. [00:48:40.090000-00:48:41.790000] I don't know.
118. [00:48:47.390000-00:48:48.890000] Hey.
119. [00:48:48.960000-00:48:50.800000] So the files are on their way.
120. [00:48:50.860000-00:48:52.160000] We won?
121. [00:48:52.230000-00:48:53.160000] That's fantastic.
122. [00:48:53.230000-00:48:54.530000] So now we have a week
123. [00:48:54.600000-00:48:56.800000] to corroborate Nancy's story.
124. [00:48:56.870000-00:49:01.140000] Listen, I couldn't have done it
without you.
125. [00:49:01.210000-00:49:03.840000] You wouldn't even know
where to look without me.
126. [00:49:03.910000-00:49:04.980000] You know what nobody likes?
127. [00:49:05.040000-00:49:07.210000] Nobody likes a showoff.
128. [00:49:08.480000-00:49:10.920000] Hello.
129. [00:49:10.980000-00:49:12.080000] Yeah, he's here.
130. [00:49:12.150000-00:49:14.920000] Okay. Thank you.
131. [00:49:14.990000-00:49:16.850000] Files are in conference room C.
132. [00:49:16.920000-00:49:19.660000] Why wouldn't they bring them
to my cubicle?
133. [00:49:19.730000-00:49:22.730000] They're trying to bury you
in paperwork.
134. [00:49:22.800000-00:49:25.600000] Well, they picked
the wrong guy.
135. [00:49:25.660000-00:49:27.330000] If they didn't, I did.
136. [00:49:27.400000-00:49:28.770000] Get it done
by the end of the week.
137. [00:49:28.830000-00:49:29.970000] I got to run
and charm our new client.
138. [00:49:35.340000-00:49:37.480000] Nice to finally meet you.
139. [00:49:37.540000-00:49:41.550000] Jessica says you're
gonna sweep me off my feet.
140. [00:49:41.610000-00:49:43.680000] I'll do my best,
Mr. Dockery.
141. [00:49:43.750000-00:49:44.880000] You got a nice serve there.
142. [00:49:44.950000-00:49:47.420000] Working on it.
143. [00:49:49.820000-00:49:51.520000] What the hell is this?
144. [00:49:51.590000-00:49:52.420000] It's you having sex
with a woman
145. [00:49:52.490000-00:49:54.360000] who isn't Mrs. Dockery.
146. [00:49:54.430000-00:49:55.930000] Are you trying to blackmail me?
147. [00:49:55.990000-00:49:57.560000] You asked my firm
where you're vulnerable
148. [00:49:57.630000-00:49:58.730000] to corporate takeover.
149. [00:49:58.800000-00:50:00.400000] That's it right there.
150. [00:50:00.460000-00:50:01.460000] What are you pulling here?
151. [00:50:01.530000-00:50:02.970000] Your wife owns 10%
152. [00:50:03.030000-00:50:04.900000] of the company's voting shares.
153. [00:50:04.970000-00:50:06.540000] You've been seeing this woman
and several others
154. [00:50:06.600000-00:50:08.040000] for quite some time.
155. [00:50:08.110000-00:50:09.670000] How do you think
your wife's gonna vote
156. [00:50:09.740000-00:50:12.140000] after she finds out?
Who says she has to find out?
157. [00:50:12.210000-00:50:14.750000] My investigator got these
within a week.
158. [00:50:14.810000-00:50:17.350000] What do you think
a motivated competitor's
159. [00:50:17.420000-00:50:19.180000] gonna dig up in a year?
160. [00:50:21.520000-00:50:23.850000] I have a solution.
161. [00:50:23.920000-00:50:25.760000] Trade her your preferred shares,
162. [00:50:25.820000-00:50:27.120000] which have no voting rights,
163. [00:50:27.190000-00:50:29.160000] for her common shares,
which do.
164. [00:50:29.230000-00:50:31.560000] The preferred shares
are worth $2 million more.
165. [00:50:31.630000-00:50:32.900000] A fraction of what you'll lose
166. [00:50:32.960000-00:50:34.600000] if you get voted
out of your company.
167. [00:50:34.660000-00:50:36.030000] John, I don't care if you sleep
168. [00:50:36.100000-00:50:37.530000] with every woman
in the Hamptons.
169. [00:50:37.600000-00:50:39.730000] Just give her
the preferred shares.
170. [00:50:42.300000-00:50:45.070000] Jessica said you were gonna
charm me to get my business.
171. [00:50:45.140000-00:50:46.840000] I'm not interested
in getting your business.
172. [00:50:46.910000-00:50:49.410000] I'm interested in keeping it.
173. [00:50:49.480000-00:50:51.550000] I know where
they don't want us to look.
174. [00:50:51.610000-00:50:54.080000] Did you get through
all those files in one night?
175. [00:50:54.150000-00:50:55.480000] I would have done it faster,
176. [00:50:55.550000-00:50:57.250000] but I ordered a pizza.
177. [00:50:57.320000-00:50:59.320000] Speaking of which,
have you ever had
178. [00:50:59.390000-00:51:00.920000] the cheese in the crust?
179. [00:51:00.990000-00:51:03.860000] Because it blew my mind.
What'd you find?
180. [00:51:03.920000-00:51:06.860000] There was a dismissal
on march 12th, 2005.
181. [00:51:06.930000-00:51:09.160000] But the file with the employee
name on it is missing.
182. [00:51:09.230000-00:51:10.760000] It's our woman.
I know it is.
183. [00:51:10.830000-00:51:12.760000] I'm moving to slap sanctions
184. [00:51:12.830000-00:51:14.530000] on their attorney,
possible jail time.
185. [00:51:14.600000-00:51:16.300000] Guy's not gonna know
what hit him.
186. [00:51:16.370000-00:51:20.070000] Dennis, it's Harvey Specter.
187. [00:51:20.140000-00:51:23.940000] Did you have anything to do
with the march 12, 2005 files
188. [00:51:24.010000-00:51:26.110000] left out of discovery?
189. [00:51:26.180000-00:51:28.450000] If they're here by noon,
I'll believe you.
190. [00:51:28.510000-00:51:31.650000] If not,
we're filing for sanctions.
191. [00:51:31.720000-00:51:34.050000] Threat of sanctions is better
than filing for sanctions.
192. [00:51:34.120000-00:51:36.890000] That's what I meant.
Threaten, not file.
193. [00:51:36.960000-00:51:37.960000] Who would mean that?
194. [00:51:38.030000-00:51:40.260000] Shave.
195. [00:51:40.330000-00:51:42.330000] Have you ever heard
of this woman?
196. [00:51:42.400000-00:51:43.660000] Joanna Webster?
197. [00:51:43.730000-00:51:45.360000] No. Why?
198. [00:51:45.430000-00:51:46.830000] The company's trying
to hide her from us.
199. [00:51:46.900000-00:51:48.570000] You think Hunt did
the same thing to her
200. [00:51:48.640000-00:51:50.170000] that he did to me?
Yes.
201. [00:51:50.240000-00:51:52.940000] Then you have to make her
come forward and say so.
202. [00:51:53.010000-00:51:54.370000] Yeah.
That's the plan.
203. [00:51:54.440000-00:51:56.940000] Thank you.
204. [00:52:06.320000-00:52:07.590000] Joanna Webster?
205. [00:52:07.650000-00:52:08.920000] Can I help you?
206. [00:52:08.990000-00:52:11.290000] Hi.
My name's Mike Ross.
207. [00:52:11.360000-00:52:12.520000] I'm a--
I'm a lawyer.
208. [00:52:12.590000-00:52:14.160000] I have some questions for you
209. [00:52:14.230000-00:52:17.300000] about your time
at Devlin McGreggor.
210. [00:52:17.360000-00:52:19.300000] Please. Look, just let me
tell you a story
211. [00:52:19.370000-00:52:20.400000] about my client, okay?
212. [00:52:20.470000-00:52:23.840000] Fine. Just a second.
213. [00:52:23.900000-00:52:25.340000] Mr. Ross,
214. [00:52:25.400000-00:52:27.840000] what happened to me
happened six years ago.
215. [00:52:27.910000-00:52:29.470000] It was horrible,
216. [00:52:29.540000-00:52:30.880000] and there was a reason
I didn't do anything
217. [00:52:30.940000-00:52:32.010000] about it.
218. [00:52:32.080000-00:52:33.550000] They'll put me on that stand
219. [00:52:33.610000-00:52:35.750000] and attack me,
and I don't want that.
220. [00:52:35.820000-00:52:39.750000] Ms. Webster, Joanna,
221. [00:52:39.820000-00:52:42.320000] this man is a predator,
222. [00:52:42.390000-00:52:45.460000] and if you don't help stop him,
he will do it again.
223. [00:52:48.590000-00:52:50.130000] All you have to do
is give a deposition.
224. [00:52:50.200000-00:52:51.860000] I'm sorry.
225. [00:52:51.930000-00:52:55.600000] I can't do it.
226. [00:53:03.440000-00:53:06.410000] What happened with the witness?
227. [00:53:06.480000-00:53:10.720000] Uh, I failed...
228. [00:53:10.780000-00:53:13.920000] To not be awesome.
229. [00:53:13.990000-00:53:16.350000] I got her to testify!
230. [00:53:16.420000-00:53:19.490000] You should have seen me.
I tried everything.
231. [00:53:19.560000-00:53:21.260000] He'd do it again,
232. [00:53:21.330000-00:53:22.530000] I'd be with her every step
of the way...
233. [00:53:22.600000-00:53:23.600000] Nothing worked.
234. [00:53:23.660000-00:53:26.330000] And then it hit me.
235. [00:53:26.400000-00:53:29.600000] I asked her
what if it was her daughter
236. [00:53:29.670000-00:53:31.240000] that he did this to.
237. [00:53:31.310000-00:53:34.270000] She melted.
238. [00:53:34.340000-00:53:36.340000] And you know how I came up
with that little gem?
239. [00:53:36.410000-00:53:40.520000] I cared about her.
Oh.
240. [00:53:40.580000-00:53:43.280000] Yeah.
241. [00:53:43.350000-00:53:45.220000] Thank you.
242. [00:53:45.290000-00:53:46.720000] I'm glad to see
that staying up all night
243. [00:53:46.790000-00:53:47.820000] doesn't make you act
like a complete idiot.
244. [00:53:47.890000-00:53:49.520000] Go home and get some sleep.
245. [00:53:49.590000-00:53:50.860000] I don't want you waving
that thing around
246. [00:53:50.930000-00:53:52.130000] during tomorrow's deposition.
247. [00:53:57.830000-00:53:59.500000] Harvey.
248. [00:53:59.570000-00:54:01.900000] How's the pro Bono going?
249. [00:54:01.970000-00:54:05.640000] Great. I just talked a witness
into testifying.
250. [00:54:05.710000-00:54:08.740000] Really?
What's the witness's name?
251. [00:54:10.710000-00:54:11.780000] I'm not an idiot.
252. [00:54:11.850000-00:54:13.310000] Don't treat me like one.
253. [00:54:13.380000-00:54:15.120000] You pawned off the case.
254. [00:54:15.180000-00:54:17.790000] Jessica,
I've got higher profile cases--
255. [00:54:17.850000-00:54:19.990000] Need I remind you
that when we first met,
256. [00:54:20.060000-00:54:21.760000] you were a screw-up?
257. [00:54:21.820000-00:54:23.590000] I gave you a shot
at the mail room,
258. [00:54:23.660000-00:54:26.030000] led you up the ranks, and then
paid for you to go to Harvard,
259. [00:54:26.100000-00:54:29.070000] where, by the way,
you jerked off the entire time
260. [00:54:29.130000-00:54:32.140000] you were there,
and I still hired you.
261. [00:54:32.200000-00:54:34.210000] And you've benefited
from that ever since.
262. [00:54:34.270000-00:54:36.140000] Look, I closed the Dockery case,
okay.
263. [00:54:36.210000-00:54:38.080000] You made a promise to me.
264. [00:54:38.140000-00:54:41.680000] You broke it, and then you lied
to my face.
265. [00:54:41.750000-00:54:44.750000] So let me be clear.
This isn't professional.
266. [00:54:44.820000-00:54:46.380000] This is personal.
267. [00:54:46.450000-00:54:48.120000] And I'll tell you
something else.
268. [00:54:48.190000-00:54:52.160000] You made your bed,
you better goddamn win.
269. [00:55:06.140000-00:55:09.170000] God damn it.
270. [00:55:19.190000-00:55:22.050000] What the hell is wrong with you?
I need the briefcase back.
271. [00:55:22.120000-00:55:23.590000] Oh, so that's what this
has been about, huh?
272. [00:55:23.660000-00:55:25.660000] You don't care
about our friendship at all.
273. [00:55:25.730000-00:55:27.290000] You're my oldest friend,
and you know it.
274. [00:55:27.360000-00:55:29.530000] But you don't seem
to care about that anymore,
275. [00:55:29.600000-00:55:31.130000] and, yeah, I need
the briefcase back.
276. [00:55:31.200000-00:55:32.860000] And I'm gonna find it, Mike.
277. [00:55:32.930000-00:55:34.370000] Well, I ditched it
when I was running away
278. [00:55:34.430000-00:55:37.340000] from the cops
that you sent me into.
279. [00:56:00.060000-00:56:02.360000] Mike.
280. [00:56:02.430000-00:56:04.030000] Where you going?
281. [00:56:04.100000-00:56:06.470000] To my cubicle.
282. [00:56:06.540000-00:56:09.500000] No, you're not.
It's pee in a cup time.
283. [00:56:09.570000-00:56:12.010000] I'm sorry. What?
284. [00:56:12.070000-00:56:14.440000] Drug test.
Follow me.
285. [00:56:16.180000-00:56:17.550000] I'm just gonna put my stuff
back--
286. [00:56:17.610000-00:56:19.480000] now.
287. [00:56:26.720000-00:56:30.630000] Oh, by the way, my cousin
was your year at Harvard.
288. [00:56:30.700000-00:56:32.860000] And I asked him if he knew you.
289. [00:56:32.930000-00:56:35.300000] It's so funny.
He didn't.
290. [00:56:35.370000-00:56:36.630000] Well, what's his name?
291. [00:56:36.700000-00:56:37.930000] Mitch samberg.
292. [00:56:38-00:56:39.670000] Yeah.
Don't know him.
293. [00:56:41.210000-00:56:42.310000] It's a big school.
294. [00:56:42.370000-00:56:44.370000] Not really.
295. [00:56:44.440000-00:56:47.140000] We get 7,000 applications
a year.
296. [00:56:47.210000-00:56:49.450000] You think you can just walk in
and take a tour?
297. [00:56:49.510000-00:56:51.450000] Oh, Mitchell.
298. [00:56:51.520000-00:56:52.950000] With the slicked back hair,
299. [00:56:53.020000-00:56:54.450000] graduated seventh in the class.
300. [00:56:54.520000-00:56:56.550000] Sure. Yeah.
I remember him.
301. [00:56:56.620000-00:56:58.860000] Time to face the music.
302. [00:57:04.830000-00:57:07.200000] I got to get
to the Kendrick filing.
303. [00:57:07.260000-00:57:08.360000] Where the hell is Mike?
304. [00:57:08.430000-00:57:12.130000] I don't know.
305. [00:57:12.200000-00:57:14.140000] Leave the cup on the counter.
306. [00:57:18.140000-00:57:20.010000] You'll have to leave that
out here.
307. [00:57:20.080000-00:57:22.450000] - Why?
- If you take it in there
308. [00:57:22.510000-00:57:23.750000] with you, I have to check
to make sure you don't have
309. [00:57:23.820000-00:57:24.950000] another urine sample in it.
310. [00:58:08.330000-00:58:11.430000] - Where you been?
- Hi. Um...
311. [00:58:11.500000-00:58:12.960000] Getting drug tested, actually.
312. [00:58:13.030000-00:58:15.630000] The deposition's
this afternoon.
313. [00:58:15.700000-00:58:17.500000] Before they get here, I want you
to grill this woman
314. [00:58:17.570000-00:58:18.970000] about her background
for anything they might use
315. [00:58:19.040000-00:58:20.170000] against her.
316. [00:58:20.240000-00:58:21.940000] You got it?
Got it.
317. [00:58:22.010000-00:58:23.470000] - Make her tell you everything.
- Everything.
318. [00:58:23.540000-00:58:24.570000] - Everything.
- Everything.
319. [00:58:24.640000-00:58:27.440000] - Okay.
- Okay.
320. [00:58:35.250000-00:58:38.250000] I had been working six months
321. [00:58:38.320000-00:58:41.090000] when Mr. Hunt started asking me
to work more,
322. [00:58:41.160000-00:58:42.960000] order dinner.
323. [00:58:43.030000-00:58:47.670000] One night, late, he tried
to have sex with me.
324. [00:58:47.730000-00:58:51.640000] The next day, I requested
a change in assignment.
325. [00:58:51.700000-00:58:55.340000] Two months later I was fired
for having a bad attitude.
326. [00:58:55.410000-00:58:57.940000] This is ridiculous.
327. [00:58:58.010000-00:58:59.610000] Wipe that smirk off your face.
328. [00:58:59.680000-00:59:01.110000] You're not even supposed
to be here.
329. [00:59:01.180000-00:59:03.780000] Mr. Hunt has every right
to be here.
330. [00:59:03.850000-00:59:08.050000] Now, Ms. Webster, after working
for Devlin McGreggor,
331. [00:59:08.120000-00:59:10.720000] you then went on to waitress
at Hooters, right?
332. [00:59:10.790000-00:59:13.720000] - Yes, I did.
- A place that advertises
333. [00:59:13.790000-00:59:16.160000] the sexuality
of its waitstaff, correct?
334. [00:59:16.230000-00:59:18.430000] You will have to ask them that.
335. [00:59:18.500000-00:59:20.360000] I'm asking you.
336. [00:59:20.430000-00:59:24.530000] And she's not answering.
Move on.
337. [00:59:24.600000-00:59:29.870000] Ms. Webster, would you say
that you're a truthful person?
338. [00:59:29.940000-00:59:32.480000] Yes.
339. [00:59:32.540000-00:59:35.150000] So when you said earlier
that you had never been arrested
340. [00:59:35.210000-00:59:38.320000] for a crime, you were speaking
the truth?
341. [00:59:38.380000-00:59:41.690000] - Yes.
- Yes, so in 1993 then
342. [00:59:41.750000-00:59:45.520000] you were not arrested for
stealing $1,000 worth of jewelry
343. [00:59:45.590000-00:59:48.830000] from the willow grove mall
in Pennsylvania?
344. [00:59:48.890000-00:59:53.230000] I was 17.
That was one mistake.
345. [00:59:53.300000-00:59:55.330000] Those records were supposed
to be sealed.
346. [00:59:55.400000-00:59:57.300000] So when you say
those records were sealed,
347. [00:59:57.370000-00:59:58.770000] what you mean to say
is you thought
348. [00:59:58.840000-00:59:59.800000] you could get away with a lie?
349. [00:59:59.870000-01:00:01.510000] No, that's not it.
350. [01:00:01.570000-01:00:03.510000] You're making it seem
different that it is.
351. [01:00:03.570000-01:00:06.280000] I'm sorry.
You were arrested in your past
352. [01:00:06.340000-01:00:08.010000] and you lied about it here
under oath.
353. [01:00:08.080000-01:00:10.110000] Is that
making it seem different
354. [01:00:10.180000-01:00:12.020000] than what it is?
355. [01:00:14.390000-01:00:17.960000] No answer.
Hmm, all right.
356. [01:00:18.020000-01:00:20.590000] Let me ask you this,
since you've lied here once,
357. [01:00:20.660000-01:00:23.330000] what's to make us believe
you're not lying about Mr. Hunt?
358. [01:00:36.680000-01:00:38.240000] How the hell did you miss
that arrest?
359. [01:00:38.310000-01:00:40.380000] I did every background check
we have.
360. [01:00:40.450000-01:00:41.550000] Did you grill her
like I told you to?
361. [01:00:41.610000-01:00:43.180000] It was a sealed record, Harvey!
362. [01:00:43.250000-01:00:44.180000] Goddamn it, I knew it.
363. [01:00:44.250000-01:00:45.980000] Fix it.
364. [01:00:46.050000-01:00:48.920000] Joanna!
Wait. Please!
365. [01:00:48.990000-01:00:50.660000] This is why I didn't want
to testify.
366. [01:00:50.720000-01:00:52.190000] They twist something
from 100 years ago
367. [01:00:52.260000-01:00:54.460000] and make me look like a liar.
368. [01:00:54.530000-01:00:55.630000] They make it sound
like what he did
369. [01:00:55.690000-01:00:57.230000] to me didn't happen.
370. [01:00:57.300000-01:00:58.760000] It doesn't matter.
All right?
371. [01:00:58.830000-01:01:00.160000] I just--I need you
to testify on Friday
372. [01:01:00.230000-01:01:02] and keep this case alive.
373. [01:01:02.070000-01:01:03.700000] We don't have time to find
anyone else before--
374. [01:01:03.770000-01:01:04.970000] would you please wait?
375. [01:01:05.040000-01:01:06.770000] No. I'm not waiting.
376. [01:01:06.840000-01:01:08.240000] You promised this
wouldn't happen, and it did.
377. [01:01:08.310000-01:01:10.740000] You never told me
you were arrested.
378. [01:01:10.810000-01:01:13.480000] Don't contact me again, please.
379. [01:01:51.310000-01:01:54.010000] What happened with the witness?
380. [01:01:54.080000-01:01:57.950000] Nothing. Nothing happened.
I couldn't fix it.
381. [01:01:58.020000-01:02:00.920000] So you're going to quit?
382. [01:02:00.990000-01:02:03.320000] It's either that
or have Louis Litt fire me.
383. [01:02:03.390000-01:02:04.860000] What are you talking about?
384. [01:02:04.930000-01:02:07.100000] My first day,
Louis fired Gary Lipsky
385. [01:02:07.160000-01:02:08.760000] for screwing up a case.
386. [01:02:08.830000-01:02:10.400000] He said if I did the same thing
387. [01:02:10.470000-01:02:12.500000] I'd be gone just as fast.
388. [01:02:12.570000-01:02:13.870000] Well, you go back
to the witness' house
389. [01:02:13.940000-01:02:15.640000] and you get her
to testify again.
390. [01:02:15.710000-01:02:17.570000] - I tried. There's no way.
- There's always a way.
391. [01:02:17.640000-01:02:19.070000] Then why don't you go
and convince her?
392. [01:02:19.140000-01:02:20.810000] Because you screwed it up.
393. [01:02:20.880000-01:02:22.910000] Oh, and you don't give
a damn about the client. Right.
394. [01:02:22.980000-01:02:24.720000] - That's not my job.
- Does your job
395. [01:02:24.780000-01:02:26.120000] include giving a damn about me?
396. [01:02:26.180000-01:02:27.720000] Because the least
you could do is offer
397. [01:02:27.790000-01:02:29.390000] to stand up to Louis for me.
Stand up for you?
398. [01:02:29.450000-01:02:30.760000] I put my ass
on the line for you,
399. [01:02:30.820000-01:02:32.260000] but it turns out
you may have had the balls
400. [01:02:32.320000-01:02:34.230000] to get this job,
but you don't have the courage
401. [01:02:34.290000-01:02:35.930000] to stick it out
when it gets tough.
402. [01:02:36-01:02:37.360000] - That's not true.
- Isn't it?
403. [01:02:37.430000-01:02:39.060000] You've had one foot
out the door
404. [01:02:39.130000-01:02:40.900000] since you got here.
What are you talking about?
405. [01:02:40.970000-01:02:42.230000] I'm talking
about that briefcase
406. [01:02:42.300000-01:02:43.940000] being locked in your desk.
Yeah, I saw it.
407. [01:02:44-01:02:45.900000] And I know what it is.
408. [01:02:45.970000-01:02:48.240000] It's your backup plan
in case this doesn't work out.
409. [01:02:48.310000-01:02:50.070000] You can make some quick cash
and go right back
410. [01:02:50.140000-01:02:52.380000] to the life you told me
you didn't want to lead.
411. [01:02:52.440000-01:02:55.110000] So if you want to quit,
go ahead.
412. [01:02:55.180000-01:02:58.080000] But this isn't because of Louis,
and it isn't because of me.
413. [01:02:58.150000-01:02:59.680000] It's because you're afraid
you might have to admit
414. [01:02:59.750000-01:03:01.920000] that you're not
as smart as you think you are.
415. [01:03:04.990000-01:03:06.460000] If you're here in the morning,
416. [01:03:06.530000-01:03:08.260000] I'll know
I still have an associate.
417. [01:04:00.610000-01:04:03.350000] Hey, I get that you were upset
418. [01:04:03.420000-01:04:04.980000] that I was promoted before you,
419. [01:04:05.050000-01:04:07.350000] but if you ever threaten to fire
one of my guys again,
420. [01:04:07.420000-01:04:09.790000] I am going to kick your ass.
421. [01:04:09.860000-01:04:13.230000] Hmm.
What are you talking about?
422. [01:04:13.290000-01:04:15.090000] Don't play dumb with me,
all right?
423. [01:04:15.160000-01:04:19.200000] You fired Gary Lipsky
in front of Mike Ross.
424. [01:04:19.270000-01:04:21.900000] What's so funny?
425. [01:04:21.970000-01:04:24.270000] Gary Lipsky works
in the mail room.
426. [01:04:24.340000-01:04:28.440000] - What?
- I didn't fire anyone.
427. [01:04:28.510000-01:04:29.640000] That's how I let
the new associates know
428. [01:04:29.710000-01:04:31.540000] what's expected of them.
429. [01:04:31.610000-01:04:35.450000] You plant a fake employee
to manipulate the assoc--
430. [01:04:35.520000-01:04:36.680000] that's it.
431. [01:04:36.750000-01:04:38.880000] What?
432. [01:05:03.510000-01:05:06.180000] Michael.
433. [01:05:06.250000-01:05:09.750000] I want to quit.
434. [01:05:09.820000-01:05:13.020000] Come here.
435. [01:05:22.030000-01:05:24.300000] When your parents died,
436. [01:05:24.370000-01:05:28.900000] I lost
my son and my daughter-in-law.
437. [01:05:28.970000-01:05:34.840000] I was scared, alone,
and I was too old to raise you.
438. [01:05:34.910000-01:05:36.750000] But I had no choice.
439. [01:05:36.810000-01:05:42.550000] Because who else was going
to care of my grandson?
440. [01:05:42.620000-01:05:46.320000] You made me a promise before.
441. [01:05:46.390000-01:05:49.760000] You're in the door.
442. [01:05:49.830000-01:05:52.530000] Promise me now the only way
you'll leave
443. [01:05:52.600000-01:05:55.900000] is if they rip you out.
444. [01:06:07.980000-01:06:09.520000] You can save your breath.
445. [01:06:09.580000-01:06:10.680000] There's no way I'm testifying
446. [01:06:10.750000-01:06:12.420000] at the hearing tomorrow.
447. [01:06:12.490000-01:06:14.990000] That's not why I'm here.
448. [01:06:15.050000-01:06:17.320000] I know what you did.
What are you talking about?
449. [01:06:17.390000-01:06:19.490000] You never worked
for Devlin McGreggor,
450. [01:06:19.560000-01:06:21.630000] and you were never harassed
by Mr. Hunt.
451. [01:06:21.690000-01:06:23.590000] - That's a l--
- Now I could tell you
452. [01:06:23.660000-01:06:25.900000] that I've got the canceled
checks or the wire transfer
453. [01:06:25.960000-01:06:28.770000] or whatever smoking gun
that exists--I don't.
454. [01:06:28.830000-01:06:30.270000] But I will.
And when I do,
455. [01:06:30.330000-01:06:31.830000] you'll be going to jail
unless you tell me
456. [01:06:31.900000-01:06:34.270000] what happened right now.
457. [01:06:35.970000-01:06:38.110000] I'm the guy you tell.
458. [01:06:41.180000-01:06:44.110000] All I had to do was waste
your time until tomorrow
459. [01:06:44.180000-01:06:45.980000] after the hearing.
460. [01:06:46.050000-01:06:50.020000] Please,
I just needed the money.
461. [01:06:50.090000-01:06:52.320000] I don't want to go to jail.
462. [01:06:52.390000-01:06:56.090000] Here's what you're gonna do...
463. [01:06:56.160000-01:06:59.030000] Did you call this place before?
464. [01:06:59.100000-01:07:00.800000] Mike!
465. [01:07:00.870000-01:07:01.900000] - Hey.
- I'm not giving this to you
466. [01:07:01.970000-01:07:03.670000] because you need it.
467. [01:07:03.740000-01:07:06.740000] I'm giving it to you
because I don't.
468. [01:07:06.800000-01:07:09.240000] And I don't know if I'm ready
to forgive you yet or not,
469. [01:07:09.310000-01:07:11.910000] but I do know we're even.
470. [01:07:11.980000-01:07:15.710000] Wait a second.
471. [01:07:18.950000-01:07:20.920000] I...
472. [01:07:20.990000-01:07:22.790000] Well...
473. [01:07:29.130000-01:07:31.130000] Don't.
474. [01:07:31.200000-01:07:32.160000] Now we're even.
475. [01:07:36.170000-01:07:37.170000] Huh.
476. [01:07:49.720000-01:07:54.050000] I see you came to work today.
Nice suit.
477. [01:07:54.120000-01:07:56.690000] It was a barter transaction.
478. [01:07:56.760000-01:07:59.720000] I got six of them
for one little briefcase.
479. [01:08:02.760000-01:08:06.430000] Listen...
480. [01:08:06.500000-01:08:08.430000] I'm sorry and--
481. [01:08:08.500000-01:08:11.100000] Forget it.
482. [01:08:11.170000-01:08:14.940000] When I first started,
Jessica rode me so hard...
483. [01:08:15.010000-01:08:16.940000] I quit once a month.
484. [01:08:17.010000-01:08:19.940000] I just told you
what you needed to hear.
485. [01:08:20.010000-01:08:22.950000] That's just it.
I've only ever had one person
486. [01:08:23.010000-01:08:26.720000] who told me
what I needed to hear.
487. [01:08:26.780000-01:08:29.850000] Maybe it's time I started
trusting somebody else.
488. [01:08:39.630000-01:08:41.400000] Merry Christmas.
489. [01:08:46.270000-01:08:47.330000] Is this for real?
