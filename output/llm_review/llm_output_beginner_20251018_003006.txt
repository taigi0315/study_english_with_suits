2. [00:00:48.380000-00:00:49.950000] Gerald Tate's here.
3. [00:00:50.010000-00:00:51.350000] He wants to know
what's happening to his deal.
4. [00:00:51.420000-00:00:52.880000] Go get Harvey.
5. [00:01:02.230000-00:01:04.860000] I check.
6. [00:01:04.930000-00:01:06.100000] Raise.
7. [00:01:06.160000-00:01:08.300000] 5,000.
8. [00:01:08.370000-00:01:10.370000] I'm all-in.
9. [00:01:17.370000-00:01:19.910000] You can pay me later.
I got to go.
10. [00:01:21.140000-00:01:22.580000] Gentlemen.
11. [00:01:24.080000-00:01:26.250000] I'm paying you millions,
12. [00:01:26.320000-00:01:27.920000] and you're telling me
I'm gonna get screwed?
13. [00:01:27.980000-00:01:30.650000] Jessica, have I come
at a bad time?
14. [00:01:30.720000-00:01:34.920000] Gerald, this is Harvey Specter.
15. [00:01:34.990000-00:01:37.130000] He's our best closer.
16. [00:01:37.200000-00:01:38.630000] Well, if you're
the best closer,
17. [00:01:38.700000-00:01:40.300000] where the hell you been
for the last three hours?
18. [00:01:40.370000-00:01:42.500000] Well, Gerald, I specialize
in troubled situations,
19. [00:01:42.570000-00:01:43.700000] and when I left here
at 7:00 P.M.,
20. [00:01:43.770000-00:01:45.600000] this deal wasn't in jeopardy,
21. [00:01:45.670000-00:01:47.170000] so I'm just trying to figure out
what happened in the interim.
22. [00:01:47.240000-00:01:48.540000] We keep offering more money.
23. [00:01:48.610000-00:01:50.040000] They keep rejecting it.
24. [00:01:50.110000-00:01:51.780000] It's last-minute
bad faith bullsh--.
25. [00:01:51.840000-00:01:53.810000] Says here that Cooper
won't be staying on
26. [00:01:53.880000-00:01:55.980000] as honorary vice president.
27. [00:01:56.050000-00:01:57.880000] That's right.
I don't want him around.
28. [00:01:57.950000-00:01:58.950000] He wouldn't be around.
29. [00:01:59.020000-00:02:00.250000] It's an honorary position.
30. [00:02:00.320000-00:02:01.450000] I don't give a sh--.
31. [00:02:01.520000-00:02:03.320000] Well, I think you do,
32. [00:02:03.390000-00:02:05.160000] because that's what's changed
since I left,
33. [00:02:05.220000-00:02:07.590000] which means it's you
who's been dealing in bad faith.
34. [00:02:07.660000-00:02:09.790000] Well, now that you've got
a grasp on what's happened
35. [00:02:09.860000-00:02:11.360000] in the goddamn interim,
36. [00:02:11.430000-00:02:13.100000] what are you gonna do about it?
37. [00:02:13.160000-00:02:14.760000] Because he's not getting
that title.
38. [00:02:14.830000-00:02:18.140000] Well, let me make sure
I understand this, okay?
39. [00:02:18.200000-00:02:20.740000] We negotiated a deal that
gave you everything you wanted,
40. [00:02:20.810000-00:02:23.540000] Mr. Cooper signed it,
and now you won't close
41. [00:02:23.610000-00:02:25.410000] until we take away
the last shred of his dignity?
42. [00:02:25.480000-00:02:27.580000] - Bingo.
- Well, that's not gonna happen.
43. [00:02:27.650000-00:02:29.880000] - And why the hell not?
- Because I like Mr. Cooper,
44. [00:02:29.950000-00:02:32.220000] and my firm doesn't operate
in bad faith.
45. [00:02:32.290000-00:02:35.120000] Oh.
I see how it is.
46. [00:02:35.190000-00:02:36.360000] Instead of working Cooper,
47. [00:02:36.420000-00:02:38.620000] you're working me.
48. [00:02:38.690000-00:02:41.030000] Well, why don't you take
your pansy attitude
49. [00:02:41.090000-00:02:43.630000] back in there
and make him sign my deal?
50. [00:02:43.700000-00:02:45.360000] Or I'll pay someone else
your money
51. [00:02:45.430000-00:02:47.900000] to do it for me.
First of all, Gerald,
52. [00:02:47.970000-00:02:49.740000] if you think
anyone's gonna touch this deal
53. [00:02:49.800000-00:02:52.670000] after your bad faith,
you're mistaken.
54. [00:02:52.740000-00:02:56.110000] Second, the way
our agreement works is,
55. [00:02:56.180000-00:02:57.740000] the minute Cooper
signed the deal
56. [00:02:57.810000-00:02:59.310000] which gave you everything
you wanted,
57. [00:02:59.380000-00:03:02.350000] our fee was due and payable,
which is why at 7:30
58. [00:03:02.410000-00:03:05.420000] I received confirmation
of a wire transfer
59. [00:03:05.490000-00:03:08.520000] from escrow indicating payment
in full.
60. [00:03:14.900000-00:03:16.400000] So I'd say
the ball's in your court,
61. [00:03:16.460000-00:03:19] but the truth is
your balls are in my fist.
62. [00:03:19.070000-00:03:22.470000] Now I apologize if that image
is too pansy for you,
63. [00:03:22.540000-00:03:23.900000] but I'm comfortable enough
with my manhood
64. [00:03:23.970000-00:03:25.240000] to put it out there.
65. [00:03:25.310000-00:03:26.870000] Now get your ass in there
66. [00:03:26.940000-00:03:29.980000] and close the goddamn deal.
67. [00:03:30.040000-00:03:31.740000] You gonna let him talk to me
like this?
68. [00:03:31.810000-00:03:34.150000] Harvey speaks for the firm.
69. [00:03:47.790000-00:03:50.760000] We got paid
before Gerald signed the deal?
70. [00:03:50.830000-00:03:52.200000] What are you talking about?
This is a memo
71. [00:03:52.260000-00:03:53.870000] about some fire drill
on Tuesday.
72. [00:03:53.930000-00:03:55.530000] - Huh.
- You're the Blue Team Captain.
73. [00:03:55.600000-00:03:58.440000] You get to wear a fire hat.
74. [00:04:11.420000-00:04:13.520000] Time's up.
75. [00:04:13.580000-00:04:15.950000] Pencils down.
76. [00:04:16.020000-00:04:18.790000] Excuse me.
Do I know you from somewhere?
77. [00:04:18.860000-00:04:20.720000] I don't think so.
78. [00:04:20.790000-00:04:23.700000] I have a pretty good memory
for faces.
79. [00:04:23.760000-00:04:26.860000] So do I.
80. [00:04:26.930000-00:04:30.430000] - Sorry.
- I got it.
81. [00:04:42.410000-00:04:44.610000] Hey.
Hey!
82. [00:04:44.680000-00:04:46.120000] Stop! You in the cap!
83. [00:05:19.120000-00:05:21.120000] What did you get me?
84. [00:05:21.190000-00:05:22.720000] What I said
I was gonna get you.
85. [00:05:22.790000-00:05:25.790000] A 158.
I told you I wanted a 175.
86. [00:05:25.860000-00:05:27.090000] And I told you
only 1 out of 100 people
87. [00:05:27.160000-00:05:29.030000] can score that.
88. [00:05:29.090000-00:05:32.030000] You're a B-minus student.
You got 1,000 on your sats.
89. [00:05:32.100000-00:05:33.660000] If I get you a 175,
they'll know you cheated.
90. [00:05:33.730000-00:05:36.570000] So only a genius loser
can get a 175?
91. [00:05:36.630000-00:05:39.100000] Actually, no.
I would get a 180.
92. [00:05:39.170000-00:05:41.540000] Now can I have my money,
please?
93. [00:05:47.550000-00:05:49.950000] Whoa.
This is only half.
94. [00:05:50.010000-00:05:51.450000] Then why don't you
go call the police?
95. [00:05:55.450000-00:05:58.960000] I got to get my sh--
together.
96. [00:05:59.020000-00:06:00.960000] That's the best cheeseburger
I've had in my life.
97. [00:06:01.030000-00:06:04.500000] It's from Monday, Trevor.
98. [00:06:04.560000-00:06:05.800000] Look, man, I'm serious.
99. [00:06:05.870000-00:06:07.400000] I almost got caught today.
100. [00:06:07.470000-00:06:08.870000] I've got
to stop getting stoned.
101. [00:06:08.940000-00:06:10.170000] I've got to get
my act together.
102. [00:06:10.240000-00:06:11.700000] Dude, look at me.
103. [00:06:11.770000-00:06:14.210000] You can burn bud
and still be a success.
104. [00:06:14.270000-00:06:15.880000] You sell pot for a living.
105. [00:06:15.940000-00:06:17.840000] Still saps the motivation.
106. [00:06:17.910000-00:06:20.550000] All I'm saying is, you want in,
107. [00:06:20.610000-00:06:22.010000] you are in.
108. [00:06:22.080000-00:06:24.020000] You know, that is word for word
109. [00:06:24.080000-00:06:25.920000] your offer before I got caught
110. [00:06:25.990000-00:06:28.050000] cheating on your math test
in the third grade.
111. [00:06:28.120000-00:06:29.120000] Goddamn memory.
112. [00:06:29.190000-00:06:30.890000] Stop.
113. [00:06:30.960000-00:06:33.090000] Look, no one's gonna suspect
you're a dealer.
114. [00:06:33.160000-00:06:34.090000] I mean, look at me.
115. [00:06:34.160000-00:06:35.960000] This is a $2,000 suit, Mike.
116. [00:06:36.030000-00:06:37.430000] I got, like, 12 of 'em.
117. [00:06:37.500000-00:06:39.200000] I take on
real software projects.
118. [00:06:39.260000-00:06:43.900000] I have clients who bring me
briefcases filled with cash,
119. [00:06:43.970000-00:06:45.470000] and I hand them
identical briefcases
120. [00:06:45.540000-00:06:46.940000] with vacuum-sealed bud.
121. [00:06:47.010000-00:06:48.740000] So what do you need me for?
122. [00:06:48.810000-00:06:51.010000] Well, I have a client
coming in from out of town,
123. [00:06:51.080000-00:06:52.650000] and I can't meet him,
124. [00:06:52.710000-00:06:55.620000] and I need someone I can trust
to make the drop.
125. [00:06:55.680000-00:06:57.220000] It's totally safe.
126. [00:06:57.280000-00:06:58.950000] Trevor, a person
is more likely to die
127. [00:06:59.020000-00:07:00.390000] while dealing drugs
than they would be
128. [00:07:00.450000-00:07:02.650000] on death row in Texas.
129. [00:07:02.720000-00:07:04.120000] Wait.
What are you talking about?
130. [00:07:04.190000-00:07:05.460000] It's from <i>Freakonomics.</i>
131. [00:07:05.530000-00:07:06.620000] Do you read anything
that I give you?
132. [00:07:06.690000-00:07:08.490000] It doesn't matter,
133. [00:07:08.560000-00:07:10.130000] because you have to find
somebody else.
134. [00:07:10.200000-00:07:11.360000] I'm not interested.
135. [00:07:11.430000-00:07:13.530000] Not interested in what?
136. [00:07:13.600000-00:07:14.770000] What are you doing here?
You said you were gonna stay
137. [00:07:14.830000-00:07:15.770000] at your place tonight.
138. [00:07:15.830000-00:07:17.530000] Hi, sweetie.
139. [00:07:17.600000-00:07:19] What a pleasant surprise.
140. [00:07:19.070000-00:07:20.910000] I'm so glad you stopped by.
Yeah.
141. [00:07:20.970000-00:07:22.140000] We're in the middle
of something.
142. [00:07:22.210000-00:07:24.180000] What are you in the middle of?
143. [00:07:24.240000-00:07:26.040000] Trevor's trying to set me up.
144. [00:07:26.110000-00:07:27.410000] That's terrific.
145. [00:07:27.480000-00:07:29.250000] Who's the lucky girl?
146. [00:07:29.320000-00:07:31.120000] I'm trying to get him
to work for me.
147. [00:07:31.180000-00:07:32.990000] That's a great idea.
148. [00:07:33.050000-00:07:34.520000] It will take some stress
off Trevor,
149. [00:07:34.590000-00:07:35.590000] and you'll pick up writing code
150. [00:07:35.660000-00:07:37.560000] like you do everything else.
151. [00:07:37.630000-00:07:39.060000] All right.
I got to go.
152. [00:07:39.130000-00:07:40.790000] I got go get up early
to see my grandmother
153. [00:07:40.860000-00:07:41.900000] and pay them another month.
154. [00:07:41.960000-00:07:43.460000] Oh.
155. [00:07:45.370000-00:07:46.370000] - Good night.
- Bye.
156. [00:07:49.170000-00:07:51.940000] How did you know Gerald
wouldn't look at that memo?
157. [00:07:52-00:07:54.010000] Because a charging bull
always looks at the red cape,
158. [00:07:54.070000-00:07:55.540000] not at the man with the sword.
159. [00:07:55.610000-00:07:57.680000] By the way,
I've set up a meeting
160. [00:07:57.740000-00:07:59.880000] for you and John Dockery
next week.
161. [00:07:59.950000-00:08:01.380000] Dockery?
He's Skadden's biggest client.
162. [00:08:01.450000-00:08:02.450000] Not anymore.
163. [00:08:02.510000-00:08:04.280000] He's looking around.
164. [00:08:04.350000-00:08:05.620000] He plays tennis.
I want you to close him.
165. [00:08:05.690000-00:08:07.050000] Consider it done.
166. [00:08:07.120000-00:08:10.090000] Then you are
officially dismissed
167. [00:08:10.160000-00:08:11.960000] for the evening.
168. [00:08:12.030000-00:08:13.630000] Cheers.
169. [00:08:13.690000-00:08:14.690000] Well, you two seem
to be celebrating something.
170. [00:08:14.760000-00:08:17.030000] Mm-hmm.
We are.
171. [00:08:17.100000-00:08:18.600000] In fact, you are looking
172. [00:08:18.670000-00:08:19.900000] at the best closer
this city has ever seen.
173. [00:08:19.970000-00:08:21.200000] Closer, huh?
174. [00:08:21.270000-00:08:22.600000] Baseball?
Attorney.
175. [00:08:22.670000-00:08:24.100000] I close situations.
176. [00:08:24.170000-00:08:26.010000] Hmm.
So you only care about money?
177. [00:08:26.070000-00:08:27.840000] The truth is,
I do it for the children.
178. [00:08:29.780000-00:08:31.350000] I'm Lisa.
179. [00:08:31.410000-00:08:32.650000] Harvey.
180. [00:08:32.720000-00:08:35.720000] Lisa, I don't normally do this,
181. [00:08:35.790000-00:08:37.390000] but since we are celebrating,
182. [00:08:37.450000-00:08:39.290000] what time do you get off
tonight?
183. [00:08:39.360000-00:08:41.290000] I'm glad you asked.
184. [00:08:41.360000-00:08:45.600000] I get off at ten past
"I'm never going out with you."
185. [00:08:48.170000-00:08:52.270000] I guess you're not the best
closer this city's ever seen.
186. [00:08:55.610000-00:09:03.380000] ♪ ♪
187. [00:09:06.220000-00:09:07.720000] Good morning.
188. [00:09:07.790000-00:09:09.350000] Lisa, this was lovely,
189. [00:09:09.420000-00:09:11.120000] but I'm afraid you have to go.
190. [00:09:11.190000-00:09:12.860000] - Aw.
- I hate to miss a workout,
191. [00:09:12.920000-00:09:15.160000] and I really need
to be in the office by 7:30.
192. [00:09:15.230000-00:09:17.430000] Can't we have breakfast?
193. [00:09:17.500000-00:09:18.930000] You could eat it
off my stomach.
194. [00:09:19-00:09:20.200000] I guess if I skip the gym,
195. [00:09:20.260000-00:09:22.170000] I can still get in by 9:00.
196. [00:09:33.740000-00:09:36.650000] I hear someone's
not taking their pills.
197. [00:09:36.710000-00:09:39.320000] Because they're trying
to poison me.
198. [00:09:39.380000-00:09:41.520000] Grammy, that's crazy.
199. [00:09:41.580000-00:09:42.990000] Dr. shrager gave me her word
200. [00:09:43.050000-00:09:45.490000] she wouldn't poison you
until January.
