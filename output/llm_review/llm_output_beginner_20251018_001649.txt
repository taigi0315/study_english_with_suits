2. [00:00:48.380000-00:00:49.950000] Gerald Tate's here.
3. [00:00:50.010000-00:00:51.350000] He wants to know
what's happening to his deal.
4. [00:00:51.420000-00:00:52.880000] Go get Harvey.
5. [00:01:02.230000-00:01:04.860000] I check.
6. [00:01:04.930000-00:01:06.100000] Raise.
7. [00:01:06.160000-00:01:08.300000] 5,000.
8. [00:01:08.370000-00:01:10.370000] I'm all-in.
9. [00:01:17.370000-00:01:19.910000] You can pay me later.
I got to go.
10. [00:01:21.140000-00:01:22.580000] Gentlemen.
11. [00:01:24.080000-00:01:26.250000] I'm paying you millions,
12. [00:01:26.320000-00:01:27.920000] and you're telling me
I'm gonna get screwed?
13. [00:01:27.980000-00:01:30.650000] Jessica, have I come
at a bad time?
14. [00:01:30.720000-00:01:34.920000] Gerald, this is Harvey Specter.
15. [00:01:34.990000-00:01:37.130000] He's our best closer.
16. [00:01:37.200000-00:01:38.630000] Well, if you're
the best closer,
17. [00:01:38.700000-00:01:40.300000] where the hell you been
for the last three hours?
18. [00:01:40.370000-00:01:42.500000] Well, Gerald, I specialize
in troubled situations,
19. [00:01:42.570000-00:01:43.700000] and when I left here
at 7:00 P.M.,
20. [00:01:43.770000-00:01:45.600000] this deal wasn't in jeopardy,
21. [00:01:45.670000-00:01:47.170000] so I'm just trying to figure out
what happened in the interim.
22. [00:01:47.240000-00:01:48.540000] We keep offering more money.
23. [00:01:48.610000-00:01:50.040000] They keep rejecting it.
24. [00:01:50.110000-00:01:51.780000] It's last-minute
bad faith bullsh--.
25. [00:01:51.840000-00:01:53.810000] Says here that Cooper
won't be staying on
26. [00:01:53.880000-00:01:55.980000] as honorary vice president.
27. [00:01:56.050000-00:01:57.880000] That's right.
I don't want him around.
28. [00:01:57.950000-00:01:58.950000] He wouldn't be around.
29. [00:01:59.020000-00:02:00.250000] It's an honorary position.
30. [00:02:00.320000-00:02:01.450000] I don't give a sh--.
31. [00:02:01.520000-00:02:03.320000] Well, I think you do,
32. [00:02:03.390000-00:02:05.160000] because that's what's changed
since I left,
33. [00:02:05.220000-00:02:07.590000] which means it's you
who's been dealing in bad faith.
34. [00:02:07.660000-00:02:09.790000] Well, now that you've got
a grasp on what's happened
35. [00:02:09.860000-00:02:11.360000] in the goddamn interim,
36. [00:02:11.430000-00:02:13.100000] what are you gonna do about it?
37. [00:02:13.160000-00:02:14.760000] Because he's not getting
that title.
38. [00:02:14.830000-00:02:18.140000] Well, let me make sure
I understand this, okay?
39. [00:02:18.200000-00:02:20.740000] We negotiated a deal that
gave you everything you wanted,
40. [00:02:20.810000-00:02:23.540000] Mr. Cooper signed it,
and now you won't close
41. [00:02:23.610000-00:02:25.410000] until we take away
the last shred of his dignity?
42. [00:02:25.480000-00:02:27.580000] - Bingo.
- Well, that's not gonna happen.
43. [00:02:27.650000-00:02:29.880000] - And why the hell not?
- Because I like Mr. Cooper,
44. [00:02:29.950000-00:02:32.220000] and my firm doesn't operate
in bad faith.
45. [00:02:32.290000-00:02:35.120000] Oh.
I see how it is.
46. [00:02:35.190000-00:02:36.360000] Instead of working Cooper,
47. [00:02:36.420000-00:02:38.620000] you're working me.
48. [00:02:38.690000-00:02:41.030000] Well, why don't you take
your pansy attitude
49. [00:02:41.090000-00:02:43.630000] back in there
and make him sign my deal?
50. [00:02:43.700000-00:02:45.360000] Or I'll pay someone else
your money
51. [00:02:45.430000-00:02:47.900000] to do it for me.
First of all, Gerald,
52. [00:02:47.970000-00:02:49.740000] if you think
anyone's gonna touch this deal
53. [00:02:49.800000-00:02:52.670000] after your bad faith,
you're mistaken.
54. [00:02:52.740000-00:02:56.110000] Second, the way
our agreement works is,
55. [00:02:56.180000-00:02:57.740000] the minute Cooper
signed the deal
56. [00:02:57.810000-00:02:59.310000] which gave you everything
you wanted,
57. [00:02:59.380000-00:03:02.350000] our fee was due and payable,
which is why at 7:30
58. [00:03:02.410000-00:03:05.420000] I received confirmation
of a wire transfer
59. [00:03:05.490000-00:03:08.520000] from escrow indicating payment
in full.
60. [00:03:14.900000-00:03:16.400000] So I'd say
the ball's in your court,
61. [00:03:16.460000-00:03:19] but the truth is
your balls are in my fist.
62. [00:03:19.070000-00:03:22.470000] Now I apologize if that image
is too pansy for you,
63. [00:03:22.540000-00:03:23.900000] but I'm comfortable enough
with my manhood
64. [00:03:23.970000-00:03:25.240000] to put it out there.
65. [00:03:25.310000-00:03:26.870000] Now get your ass in there
66. [00:03:26.940000-00:03:29.980000] and close the goddamn deal.
67. [00:03:30.040000-00:03:31.740000] You gonna let him talk to me
like this?
68. [00:03:31.810000-00:03:34.150000] Harvey speaks for the firm.
69. [00:03:47.790000-00:03:50.760000] We got paid
before Gerald signed the deal?
70. [00:03:50.830000-00:03:52.200000] What are you talking about?
This is a memo
71. [00:03:52.260000-00:03:53.870000] about some fire drill
on Tuesday.
72. [00:03:53.930000-00:03:55.530000] - Huh.
- You're the Blue Team Captain.
73. [00:03:55.600000-00:03:58.440000] You get to wear a fire hat.
74. [00:04:11.420000-00:04:13.520000] Time's up.
75. [00:04:13.580000-00:04:15.950000] Pencils down.
76. [00:04:16.020000-00:04:18.790000] Excuse me.
Do I know you from somewhere?
77. [00:04:18.860000-00:04:20.720000] I don't think so.
78. [00:04:20.790000-00:04:23.700000] I have a pretty good memory
for faces.
79. [00:04:23.760000-00:04:26.860000] So do I.
80. [00:04:26.930000-00:04:30.430000] - Sorry.
- I got it.
81. [00:04:42.410000-00:04:44.610000] Hey.
Hey!
82. [00:04:44.680000-00:04:46.120000] Stop! You in the cap!
83. [00:05:19.120000-00:05:21.120000] What did you get me?
84. [00:05:21.190000-00:05:22.720000] What I said
I was gonna get you.
85. [00:05:22.790000-00:05:25.790000] A 158.
I told you I wanted a 175.
86. [00:05:25.860000-00:05:27.090000] And I told you
only 1 out of 100 people
87. [00:05:27.160000-00:05:29.030000] can score that.
88. [00:05:29.090000-00:05:32.030000] You're a B-minus student.
You got 1,000 on your sats.
89. [00:05:32.100000-00:05:33.660000] If I get you a 175,
they'll know you cheated.
90. [00:05:33.730000-00:05:36.570000] So only a genius loser
can get a 175?
91. [00:05:36.630000-00:05:39.100000] Actually, no.
I would get a 180.
92. [00:05:39.170000-00:05:41.540000] Now can I have my money,
please?
93. [00:05:47.550000-00:05:49.950000] Whoa.
This is only half.
94. [00:05:50.010000-00:05:51.450000] Then why don't you
go call the police?
95. [00:05:55.450000-00:05:58.960000] I got to get my sh--
together.
96. [00:05:59.020000-00:06:00.960000] That's the best cheeseburger
I've had in my life.
97. [00:06:01.030000-00:06:04.500000] It's from Monday, Trevor.
98. [00:06:04.560000-00:06:05.800000] Look, man, I'm serious.
99. [00:06:05.870000-00:06:07.400000] I almost got caught today.
100. [00:06:07.470000-00:06:08.870000] I've got
to stop getting stoned.
