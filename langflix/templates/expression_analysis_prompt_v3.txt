**YOUR MISSION:**
Find 1-3 expressions that English learners would be EXCITED to learn - expressions they'd actually use and remember.

**LANGUAGE LEVEL:** {level_description}

---

**THE NORTH STAR PRINCIPLE:**
Ask yourself: "Would I be excited to teach THIS expression to a friend learning English?"

If the answer is YES because:
- ✓ It's used frequently in real English conversations
- ✓ It sounds natural and native-like
- ✓ It's memorable because of the scene's energy (funny/dramatic/tense)
- ✓ Learners would actually say this in their daily life

Then it's worth extracting.

If the answer is NO because:
- ✗ It's too obvious or simple
- ✗ It's too specific to this one situation
- ✗ The scene is boring or flat
- ✗ It's awkward phrasing or too formal/legal jargon
- ✗ You can't imagine when learners would use this

Then skip it.

---

**WHAT MAKES AN EXPRESSION "BEST":**

**1. COMMON & REUSABLE** (Most Important!)
- Used frequently by native speakers across different situations
- Not tied to just legal/office settings - can be used in everyday life
- Something you'd hear in conversations, movies, casual settings
- Test: "Would native speakers use this expression at least once a week?"
- **COMPLEXITY REQUIREMENT:** The expression should be substantial enough to be worth learning:
  * Multi-word phrases (3+ words preferred): "get on my nerves", "blow off steam", "cut to the chase"
  * Phrasal verbs with interesting usage: "put up with", "come up with", "figure out"
  * NOT simple curses or basic 1-2 word phrases: avoid "bullshit", "screw you", "damn it"
  * The expression should have a non-obvious meaning or usage pattern

**2. ENGAGING SCENE**
The expression appears in a scene that is:
- Humorous, dramatic, tense, emotional, or witty
- NOT boring procedural talk or flat information delivery
- Has energy and personality
- Makes the expression memorable

**3. CLEARLY USEFUL**
- Idiomatic expressions, phrasal verbs, or colloquial phrases
- Not just regular vocabulary or obvious statements
- Appropriate for your target level: {level_description}

---

**STRICT FILTERS - NEVER EXTRACT:**
- ✗ Plain statements with no special expression ("I agree", "That's good")
- ✗ Scene-specific phrases that only work in this exact context
- ✗ Overly formal legal jargon (unless it's commonly used in general conversation)
- ✗ Random sentence fragments that aren't actual expressions
- ✗ Boring exchanges with no emotional energy
- ✗ Expressions that are self-explanatory and obvious

---

**UNDERSTANDING THE STORY FIRST:**

Before extracting expressions, take time to understand:
1. **What's happening in this scene?** - The situation, conflict, or interaction
2. **Who are the characters?** - Their relationships and motivations
3. **What's the emotional tone?** - Is it tense? Funny? Dramatic?
4. **Why does this moment matter?** - What makes it interesting or memorable?

This understanding will help you:
- Select the most engaging expressions
- Provide context that tells a mini-story
- Create translations that capture the natural flow and meaning (의역), not just literal words (직역)

---

**CONTEXT DESIGN - TELL A MINI-STORY:**

**GOAL:** Learners should be able to follow the story AND learn the expression naturally.

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLES:**

1. **LONGER, STORY-RICH CONTEXT (25-45 seconds typical)**
   - Give enough dialogue to understand WHO these people are and WHAT'S happening
   - Include the setup that makes the expression make sense
   - Include reactions that show the impact or meaning
   - Let viewers follow the narrative flow naturally

2. **EXPRESSION PLACEMENT:**
   - The expression should appear naturally in the middle of the story
   - NOT at the very beginning (needs setup)
   - NOT at the very end (needs reaction/closure)

3. **COMPLETE STORY ARC:**
   - **Beginning:** Establish situation/conflict (3-8 seconds)
   - **Middle:** Expression appears in context (2-5 seconds)
   - **End:** Reaction/response that completes the moment (3-8 seconds)

4. **START AND END POINTS:**
   - **Start Time:** Begin when the situation/topic begins (NEVER mid-sentence)
   - **End Time:** End when the moment feels complete and resolved (NEVER cutting someone off)
   - Include full sentences at boundaries - no partial phrases

**LENGTH GUIDELINES:**
- **Minimum:** 25 seconds (rarely shorter - only for very simple, self-contained exchanges)
- **Sweet Spot:** 30-40 seconds (most expressions work best here)
- **Maximum:** 45 seconds (for complex situations requiring more setup)

**Quick Test:**
- Can someone who's never seen the show understand what's happening?
- Does it feel like a complete mini-scene, not a random fragment?
- Would learners enjoy watching this clip for the story itself?
- Is the expression's usage crystal clear from the context?

---

**EXTRACTING THE EXPRESSION - GIVE MORE CONTEXT:**

**NEW APPROACH: Expand the phrase to include meaningful context**

Instead of extracting just the bare minimum phrase, include enough surrounding words to make the expression's usage pattern clear and natural.

**EXAMPLES:**

❌ TOO SHORT (old way):
- "figure out"
- "deal with"
- "come up with"

✅ BETTER (new way - includes usage context):
- "figure out what to do"
- "deal with this situation"
- "come up with a solution"
- "I can't deal with this right now"
- "We need to figure out how to handle this"

**GUIDELINES:**
- Include the verb AND its natural object/complement when relevant
- Include necessary prepositions or particles that show usage
- Include subject pronouns if they're part of the natural usage pattern
- Make it a chunk that learners can memorize and reuse
- Still focus on the KEY phrase, but give it breathing room

**BALANCE:**
- Don't make it so long it becomes a full sentence
- Don't make it so short it's unclear how to use it
- Aim for 4-8 words typically
- It should feel like a natural "chunk" of language

---

**TRANSLATION STRATEGY - 의역 (Natural Translation):**

**CRITICAL: Translations should feel natural in {target_language}, not word-for-word.**

**For DIALOGUE translations:**
- Translate how a real person would say it in {target_language}
- Capture the emotion and intention, not just literal words
- Consider the relationship between speakers and the situation
- Make it flow naturally as if it were originally in {target_language}

**For EXPRESSION translations:**
- Focus on the functional meaning in this specific context
- Use {target_language} expressions that convey the same feeling
- Adapt to the story and emotional tone
- If there's a perfect {target_language} equivalent idiom, use it
- If not, explain the meaning naturally in {target_language}

**EXAMPLE:**
- Literal (직역): "그것을 공원 밖으로 치다" ❌
- Natural (의역): "완벽하게 해내다" ✓

---

**EXPRESSION_DIALOGUE - COMPLETE SENTENCES ONLY:**

**CRITICAL RULE: Never cut a sentence in the middle**

- **expression_dialogue** must be a COMPLETE, FULL sentence from the subtitles
- Start from the beginning of the sentence (capital letter or after period/question mark/exclamation)
- End at the sentence's natural end (period, question mark, exclamation point)
- Include all words from start to finish - no cutting

**EXAMPLES:**

❌ WRONG (cut in middle):
- "really need to figure this out"
- "can't believe you would"

✅ CORRECT (full sentence):
- "We really need to figure this out."
- "I can't believe you would do this to me."
- "Are you seriously going to make me deal with this alone?"

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
- Learners need to see proper sentence structure
- Partial sentences confuse grammar understanding
- Complete sentences show natural English rhythm and flow

---

**PROCESS:**

**STEP 0:** Read and understand the entire scene
   - What's the story here?
   - Who are these people and what do they want?
   - What's the emotion or tension?

**STEP 1:** Scan the dialogue for expressions that pass the North Star test.

**STEP 2:** Rank them by:
   1. How common/reusable the expression is
   2. How engaging the scene is
   3. How appropriate for the target level

**STEP 3:** For each top expression, design story-rich context:
   - Plan 25-45 seconds that tells a complete mini-story
   - Ensure the expression appears naturally in the middle
   - Verify learners can follow what's happening

**STEP 4:** Select the TOP 1-3 BEST expressions only. Quality over quantity.
