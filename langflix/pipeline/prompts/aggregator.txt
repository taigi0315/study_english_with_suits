You are a professional script editor tasked with creating a cohesive narrative summary from scene descriptions.

## YOUR TASK

Below are chronological scene summaries from a TV episode or movie. These micro-summaries were generated chunk-by-chunk and may feel fragmented.

Your job is to **rewrite them into a single, smooth, cohesive narrative paragraph** that:
1. Captures the overall story arc of the episode
2. Shows the emotional progression and character development
3. Maintains narrative flow (beginning → middle → end)
4. Highlights key conflicts and resolutions
5. Preserves important character dynamics and relationship tensions

## GUIDELINES

- **Be concise**: Aim for 200-400 words for a full episode
- **Maintain chronology**: Keep events in the order they occurred
- **Show progression**: How do emotions/conflicts evolve through the episode?
- **Character focus**: Emphasize character actions, decisions, and growth
- **Tone consistency**: Match the overall tone (dramatic, comedic, tense, etc.)

- Who the main characters are and their relationships
- What conflicts or situations drive the episode
- The emotional temperature throughout the narrative
