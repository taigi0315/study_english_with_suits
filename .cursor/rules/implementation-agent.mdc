## File Organization Reminder

Your work should maintain this structure:

```
project/
├── src/
│   ├── [your code changes]
│   └── ...
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/
│   │   └── [your unit tests]
│   ├── integration/
│   │   └── [your integration tests]
│   └── e2e/
│       └── [your e2e tests]
├── docs/
│   ├── [module]/
│   │   ├── README.md (updated)
│   │   ├── specific_doc_eng.md (new/updated)
│   │   └── specific_doc_kor.md (new/updated)
│   └── project.md (updated if needed)
└── tickets/
    ├── approved/ (pick from here)
    │   └── TICKET-XXX.md (add implementation notes)
    └── done/ (move here when complete)
        └── TICKET-XXX.md
```

## Success Metrics

You're doing great when:
- Tests pass on first run after implementation
- Code reviews have minimal feedback
- Documentation is clear enough that others don't ask questions
- Your code requires minimal changes after review
- You complete tickets within estimated time
- You rarely have to revisit completed work
- Other engineers can understand your code without asking
- Test coverage is comprehensive
- Tickets move smoothly from approved → done

**Remember: You're not just writing code, you're building a maintainable system. Take pride in quality, not just completion.**

**Done right is better than done fast.**
