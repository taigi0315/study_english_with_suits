**YOUR MISSION:**
Find 1-3 expressions that English learners would be EXCITED to learn - expressions they'd actually use and remember.

**LANGUAGE LEVEL:** {level_description}

---

**THE NORTH STAR PRINCIPLE:**
Ask yourself: "Would I be excited to teach THIS expression to a friend learning English?"

If the answer is YES because:
- ✓ It's used frequently in real English conversations
- ✓ It sounds natural and native-like
- ✓ It's memorable because of the scene's energy (funny/dramatic/tense)
- ✓ Learners would actually say this in their daily life

Then it's worth extracting.

If the answer is NO because:
- ✗ It's too obvious or simple
- ✗ It's too specific to this one situation
- ✗ The scene is boring or flat
- ✗ It's awkward phrasing or too formal/legal jargon
- ✗ You can't imagine when learners would use this

Then skip it.

**WHAT MAKES AN EXPRESSION "BEST":**

**1. COMMON & REUSABLE** (Most Important!)
- Used frequently by native speakers across different situations
- Not tied to just legal/office settings - can be used in everyday life
- Something you'd hear in conversations, movies, casual settings
- Test: "Would native speakers use this expression at least once a week?"

**2. ENGAGING SCENE**
The expression appears in a scene that is:
- Humorous, dramatic, tense, emotional, or witty
- NOT boring procedural talk or flat information delivery
- Has energy and personality
- Makes the expression memorable

**3. CLEARLY USEFUL**
- Idiomatic expressions, phrasal verbs, or colloquial phrases
- Not just regular vocabulary or obvious statements
- Appropriate for your target level: {level_description}

---

**STRICT FILTERS - NEVER EXTRACT:**
- ✗ Plain statements with no special expression ("I agree", "That's good")
- ✗ Scene-specific phrases that only work in this exact context
- ✗ Overly formal legal jargon (unless it's commonly used in general conversation)
- ✗ Random sentence fragments that aren't actual expressions
- ✗ Boring exchanges with no emotional energy
- ✗ Expressions that are self-explanatory and obvious
- ✗ No repeating dialogue. even if there are two good expression in one context, DO NOT repeat it.

**CONTEXT SLICING (Keep it Simple):**

**Goal:** Create a 10-25 second clip where:
1. Someone with NO knowledge of the show can understand what's happening
2. The expression appears naturally in the middle of the conversation
3. There's a beginning (setup), middle (expression), and end (reaction/closure)

**Start Time:** Begin when the topic/situation starts (not mid-sentence)
**End Time:** End after the reaction or when the moment completes (not cut-off)

**Quick Test:** Watch your selected clip mentally. Does it feel like a complete, satisfying moment? Or does it feel randomly chopped?

---

**PROCESS:**

**STEP 1:** Scan the entire dialogue. List mentally all expressions that pass the North Star test.

**STEP 2:** Rank them by:
   1. How common/reusable the expression is
   2. How engaging the scene is
