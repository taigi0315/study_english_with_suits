00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,140
I respect that.

161
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,875
Thanks?

162
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,076
See, but I don't
understand something now.

163
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,345
If you didn't know how
to file a patent,

164
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,047
then why didn't
you just run to Harvey?

165
00:06:54,115 --> 00:06:55,948
[Scoffs]

166
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,451
He was busy.

167
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,286
But you see, Mike,
that's why you come to see me.

168
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:03,456
[Sighs]

169
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:09,429
Look, Mike, I know...
I can come across a bit...

170
00:07:09,497 --> 00:07:11,998
Prickly.
[Chuckles]

171
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:13,233
[Clears throat]
But we're a team here.

172
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:16,203
That means I'm here to help.

173
00:07:18,974 --> 00:07:21,209
Okay, all right.

174
00:07:21,277 --> 00:07:22,477
So can you help me now?

175
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:28,217
I already have.

176
00:07:28,284 --> 00:07:29,852
Are--

177
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,755
Thank you, Louis.

178
00:07:37,762 --> 00:07:40,264
[Phone ringing]
Donna, blue is your color.

179
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:41,932
Is Harvey back?
[Giggles]

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,968
No.
Can I put this on his desk?

181
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:45,870
Yes.

182
00:07:45,937 --> 00:07:48,038
Will you tell him
I put it there hours ago?

183
00:07:48,106 --> 00:07:51,909
What time you want me to say?

184
00:07:51,977 --> 00:07:54,011
- 11:00 am?
- Absolutely.

185
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,479
[Sighs]

186
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:57,615
And then maybe I can use
my access to his bank accounts.

187
00:07:57,682 --> 00:08:00,985
To buy myself
a house in the Hamptons.

188
00:08:01,052 --> 00:08:01,952
- 12:15?
- No.

189
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,421
[Sighs]

190
00:08:10,662 --> 00:08:13,396
[Knocks] You wanted to see me?

191
00:08:17,168 --> 00:08:20,003
Sit down.

192
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,178
I looked through your work on
the Bainbridge briefs.

193
00:08:32,684 --> 00:08:34,419
Spectacular.

194
00:08:34,487 --> 00:08:36,555
[Scoffs]

195
00:08:36,622 --> 00:08:37,923
You caught the discrepancies

196
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:39,658
between listed assets and
potential assets.

197
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:40,993
That had a huge impact, Mike.

198
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:42,862
Yeah, I know.
Millions.

199
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:45,298
But anyone
would've caught that, right?

200
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:47,933
Um, out of the 50 associates
that are under purview,

201
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:49,368
not one of them
would've caught that.

202
00:08:49,436 --> 00:08:51,370
You just have
this eye for detail, Mike.

203
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:53,205
I mean, no wonder
Harvey's so crazy about you.

204
00:08:53,273 --> 00:08:54,373
It's amazing.
I mean, I really,

205
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:56,041
really, seriously
appreciate that.

206
00:08:56,109 --> 00:08:59,844
Hey, thank you, Louis.

207
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:00,946
That's nice.

208
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:02,981
You know that I pick a...

209
00:09:03,048 --> 00:09:04,716
Pony out of the herd
every year, don't you?

210
00:09:04,784 --> 00:09:06,818
- A pony?
- Oh, yeah.

211
00:09:06,886 --> 00:09:08,487
Someone who shows potential.

212
00:09:08,555 --> 00:09:10,289
Stamp my own little
brand on him.

213
00:09:10,357 --> 00:09:11,824
Mm.

214
00:09:11,891 --> 00:09:13,159
Are you that pony, Mike?

215
00:09:18,298 --> 00:09:21,267
I...Work for Harvey.

216
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:22,468
As you should.

217
00:09:22,536 --> 00:09:24,237
Good.

218
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:25,639
Well, listen,
I have some work to get to.

219
00:09:25,706 --> 00:09:28,942
So maybe we can meet
for lunch tomorrow at the club.

220
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:31,077
Say, 1:00pm?
Uh, you know, tomorrow...

221
00:09:31,145 --> 00:09:32,412
I know I just
posed that as a question,

222
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
but I really
didn't mean it that way.

223
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:42,824
Hey, what's up?

224
00:09:42,892 --> 00:09:44,793
We just heard from Wyatt.

225
00:09:44,861 --> 00:09:46,828
He got a response
from the patent office.

226
00:09:46,896 --> 00:09:49,330
And?

227
00:09:49,398 --> 00:09:50,364
It's been denied.

228
00:09:50,432 --> 00:09:51,733
What?

229
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,968
Evidently, there was
a similar claim.

230
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:55,903
Wait, what do you mean?
Somebody beat us to it?

231
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:58,072
No, someone beat you to it.

232
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,273
They filed
less than 24 hours ago,

233
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:03,343
which means you filed a day
later than you said you would.

234
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:04,845
I tried to tell you that
I didn't know how to do that.

235
00:10:04,913 --> 00:10:06,046
And I told you to
figure it out.

236
00:10:06,114 --> 00:10:07,781
And I did, and it got filed.

237
00:10:07,849 --> 00:10:10,451
After you lied and said
you'd already followed through.

238
00:10:14,223 --> 00:10:16,891
Okay, what's gonna happen now?

239
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,493
I suggest you get on the phone,

240
00:10:18,561 --> 00:10:20,895
call the patent office,
and find out who beat us to it.

241
00:10:20,963 --> 00:10:23,465
Then you're gonna have Donna
find any judge who will listen,

242
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:25,000
so we can get an injunction,

243
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:27,035
and stop whoever it is from
launching their product first.

244
00:10:27,103 --> 00:10:28,537
Okay, got it.

245
00:10:28,605 --> 00:10:29,972
Now I've gotta call Wyatt
and calm him down.

246
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,773
You think that's
gonna be a walk in the park?

247
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,878
Hey, Harvey...

248
00:10:36,946 --> 00:10:39,247
Did you tell him it was me?

249
00:10:39,315 --> 00:10:42,016
Why would I do that?
I'm responsible for you.

250
00:10:42,084 --> 00:10:44,319
It was me.

251
00:10:48,157 --> 00:10:49,357
[Sighs]

252
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:52,627
[Scoffs softly]

253
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:07,075
They signed
the paperwork, Wyatt.

254
00:11:07,142 --> 00:11:08,576
They can't pull out.

255
00:11:08,644 --> 00:11:11,145
The patent dispute
is not an issue, okay?

256
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,847
No, they cut the check.
End of story.

257
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:17,650
I'm in court right now,
let me call you back.

258
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,552
So it's
velocity data solutions.

259
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,287
Did you serve them
with notice of the hearing?

260
00:11:21,355 --> 00:11:22,955
A billion dollar company.

261
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:25,791
The bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

262
00:11:27,827 --> 00:11:29,427
Did you not
see the sign outside?

263
00:11:29,495 --> 00:11:31,296
I'm just putting it away,
your honor.

264
00:11:31,364 --> 00:11:32,464
It should already be
in your pocket.

265
00:11:32,532 --> 00:11:34,199
But you were
already running late,

266
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:36,334
so perhaps
that's why it wasn't.

267
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:39,204
Let the records show that
the counsel is fined $1,000

268
00:11:39,271 --> 00:11:40,905
for failing to follow
the posted rules of the court.

269
00:11:40,973 --> 00:11:42,974
- Your honor, I didn't mean--
- And for mouthing off.

270
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:44,576
[Softly] Mouthing off?

271
00:11:44,644 --> 00:11:47,980
Another outburst like that,
and you will be escorted out.

272
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,983
Wow.

273
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:55,288
Mr. Salinger?

274
00:11:55,356 --> 00:11:56,890
Your honor,
this is a waste of your time.

275
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,326
The U.S. patent office
is the only judicial body

276
00:11:59,394 --> 00:12:01,562
that should be
handling this dispute.

277
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,766
Velocity data solutions
requests dismissal.

278
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:08,103
Your honor.
If I may?

279
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:12,039
- This injunction request--
- Counsel approach.

280
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:21,882
That's the exhibit filing?

281
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,384
Why wasn't I
given a courtesy copy?

282
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:27,720
Given the expedited nature
of this hearing, I--

283
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,055
Hand it to me.
Hand it to me.

284
00:12:37,098 --> 00:12:38,999
And I would've assumed
that a lawyer

285
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:40,934
appearing before
a judge would come on time,

286
00:12:41,002 --> 00:12:44,371
with his mouth shut, and
prepared with a courtesy brief.

287
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:49,310
- My apologies.
- Request denied.

288
00:12:49,378 --> 00:12:52,847
[Gavel thuds]
Court adjourned for morning.

289
00:12:52,915 --> 00:12:54,616
Better luck next time, Harvey.

290
00:12:58,354 --> 00:13:01,123
From now on, I want him
when I go against you.

291
00:13:05,228 --> 00:13:06,662
Wait here.

292
00:13:10,634 --> 00:13:12,434
- Your honor, I have--
- Send him in.

293
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,981
Counselor?

294
00:13:25,048 --> 00:13:27,149
You asked to see me.

295
00:13:27,217 --> 00:13:28,718
You must have something to say.

296
00:13:28,786 --> 00:13:30,753
Excluding friends, associates,

297
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:32,055
and the clients
that I represent,

298
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:33,256
there are very few people

299
00:13:33,324 --> 00:13:34,825
that I'm on
a first name basis with.

300
00:13:34,893 --> 00:13:36,393
And I've never had anyone,

301
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,763
let alone
a judge I've never met,

302
00:13:39,831 --> 00:13:42,432
address me as Harvey
in open court.

303
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,900
But if you're gonna screw me,

304
00:13:43,968 --> 00:13:47,271
I guess it's only fair
that you call me by name.

305
00:13:47,338 --> 00:13:48,472
I could have
you brought up on review

306
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,740
for talking to me like that.

307
00:13:49,808 --> 00:13:51,842
Then we can
get it all on record.

308
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,112
- Get what?
- Whatever it is

309
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:56,548
that you seem to have against me
for no apparent reason.

310
00:13:56,615 --> 00:13:59,251
I have a solid argument for
any reasonable judge

311
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:02,121
to grant my injunction.
So solid it begs the question,

312
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:04,123
why do you have it in for me?

313
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,891
And I don't even know
your first name.

314
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:07,760
Really?

315
00:14:07,827 --> 00:14:10,262
My wife never mentioned it?
Your wife?

316
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:12,530
The woman you had
an affair with last month?

317
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:18,552
Wait, what happened in there?

318
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,420
Donna, the address for
that fundraiser

319
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:21,821

It's how they determine
who wins these situations.

00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,326
before these dot-com
millionaires,

478
00:20:55,394 --> 00:20:56,761
there were men of substance
in this club.

479
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:59,763
You know, men who understood
how business gets done.

480
00:20:59,831 --> 00:21:02,166
Well, maybe he's just not
interested in talking business

481
00:21:02,234 --> 00:21:04,267
while he's in a towel.
Like, he's not interested

482
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:06,136
because he doesn't
think I'm cool.

483
00:21:06,204 --> 00:21:07,504
And he's a pothead who thinks

484
00:21:07,572 --> 00:21:09,740
that anybody who
doesn't smoke is a nerd.

485
00:21:09,807 --> 00:21:12,109
I mean...

486
00:21:12,176 --> 00:21:13,777
So I treat my body
like a temple?

487
00:21:13,844 --> 00:21:16,813
Does that make me uncool?
I don't think so.

488
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,615
No.

489
00:21:19,683 --> 00:21:21,550
But on the other hand...

490
00:21:21,618 --> 00:21:24,120
You kinda seem his type.

491
00:21:24,187 --> 00:21:25,888
- Why do you say that?
- Because you're young.

492
00:21:25,956 --> 00:21:29,392
And you think
of yourself as...Hip.

493
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:31,594
Whatever, I guess.
You know, I'm sure you

494
00:21:31,662 --> 00:21:35,698
enjoyed
the occasional bong hit.

495
00:21:35,766 --> 00:21:38,501
No.
No, I don't smoke.

496
00:21:40,337 --> 00:21:41,571
[Chuckles]

497
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:42,706
I mean, that's just
a little strange.

498
00:21:42,773 --> 00:21:44,107
Why is it strange?

499
00:21:44,175 --> 00:21:46,543
I mean, because
the drug test that you took--

500
00:21:46,611 --> 00:21:49,346
Well, that I made you take--
Would indicate otherwise.

501
00:21:58,856 --> 00:22:00,256
You're not gonna
dispute it now, are you?

502
00:22:00,324 --> 00:22:01,857
[Sighs]

503
00:22:01,925 --> 00:22:04,126
Relax, Mike.

504
00:22:04,194 --> 00:22:05,227
Relax.

505
00:22:05,295 --> 00:22:06,895
I'm not offended.

506
00:22:06,963 --> 00:22:08,263
I'm not even surprised.

507
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,431
And in fact, in this instance,

508
00:22:09,498 --> 00:22:11,133
we can use this
to our advantage.

509
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,601
What are you
talking about, Louis?

510
00:22:12,668 --> 00:22:14,136
I'm just saying,
you know, back in the day,

511
00:22:14,204 --> 00:22:15,938
to woo a client you
would take him to dinner,

512
00:22:16,006 --> 00:22:17,239
you would buy him a drink.

513
00:22:17,307 --> 00:22:18,640
But that's
not gonna work with Tom.

514
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,244
Not in a million years.
Not with me, anyway.

515
00:22:21,311 --> 00:22:23,145
But with
someone of his generation

516
00:22:23,213 --> 00:22:24,480
who shares
the same proclivities?

517
00:22:24,548 --> 00:22:26,883
You saying you want me
to smoke pot with him?

518
00:22:26,951 --> 00:22:29,119
I'm saying you can
help me land him as a client.

519
00:22:32,257 --> 00:22:33,758
That's the only
reason I'm here, isn't it?

520
00:22:33,825 --> 00:22:35,093
No, Mike.
Stop.

521
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,661
Just stop, okay?

522
00:22:36,729 --> 00:22:39,231
I assure you, no one was
more disappointed than me

523
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,667
when I found out the results
of your drug test, okay?

524
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,769
Then I had to say to myself,
"Louis, do what you do,

525
00:22:43,837 --> 00:22:47,440
make lemonade."

526
00:22:47,508 --> 00:22:50,610
And if I don't?

527
00:22:50,678 --> 00:22:53,879
You're a smart kid.

528
00:22:53,947 --> 00:22:55,548
And I really
wanna see you succeed.

529

Ball's in your court.

530
00:23:08,729 --> 00:23:10,530
Hey, Tom, I was
just gonna tell you,

531
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,332
I wanted to--
Okay.

532

[Sighs]

533
00:23:17,738 --> 00:23:19,205
Dude creeps me out, man.

00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,174
And he never
wears a towel, ever.

535
00:23:21,241 --> 00:23:22,875
Yeah, tell me about it.

536
00:23:26,713 --> 00:23:28,781
Hey, I know you must
hear this all the time,

537

but totally addicted
to your website, man.

538
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:35,054
All right, who placed sixth
in passing yards last year?

539
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,923
[Chuckles] Carson Palmer.

3,970.

541
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:40,259
How many sacks
did James Hall have?

542
00:23:40,327 --> 00:23:42,062
11?

543
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,164
Uh-uh.
Ten and a half.

544
00:23:44,232 --> 00:23:46,466
- Yeah, I know, I rounded up.
- Well, your league doesn't

545
00:23:46,534 --> 00:23:47,935
or I would've
come in better than 20th.

546
00:23:50,905 --> 00:23:53,107
Your Ross's raiders, right?

547
00:23:53,175 --> 00:23:54,809
[Chuckles] Yeah, Mike Ross.

548
00:23:54,876 --> 00:23:56,878
- Tom Keller.
- Good to meet you.

549
00:23:56,945 --> 00:23:58,813
Congratulations, man, you
got a nice little team there.

550
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,248
Yeah.

551
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:01,616
No, if Roethlisberger
hadn't let you down,

552
00:24:01,683 --> 00:24:03,084
you'd have been top ten
for sure, I'm telling you.

553
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:04,385
Yeah, well, that's what happens

554
00:24:04,453 --> 00:24:06,620
when you get high
before the draft, right?

555
00:24:06,688 --> 00:24:09,556
You get high?

to file this, golden boy.

Oh, my God.

kidding me with that guy?

I was on the phone with them,

- Look at me.

to you in a towel,
what happened?

some advice.

just took the time--

00:28:36,307 --> 00:28:39,043
for velocity on the line.
Put them through.

637
00:28:45,618 --> 00:28:47,520
What happened after you smoked?

638
00:28:47,587 --> 00:28:49,522
- Here.
- I just got paranoid.

639
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,724
I felt bad for lying to him,

640
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:55,028
I told him that Louis
put me up to it

641
00:28:55,095 --> 00:28:55,962
and that he couldn't trust him.

642
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,597
So what did he say?

643
00:28:57,665 --> 00:29:00,133
He said that Louis
gave him the creeps anyway.

644
00:29:00,201 --> 00:29:01,501
You know,
he's never gonna hire him.

645
00:29:01,569 --> 00:29:02,803
Okay, you have to tell Harvey.

646
00:29:04,238 --> 00:29:06,005
I tried, he wasn't listening.

647
00:29:06,073 --> 00:29:07,841
So then go home
and tell him tomorrow.

648
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:10,010
Oh, God, you should've
seen his face.

649
00:29:10,078 --> 00:29:12,846
We had a deal.
What deal?

650
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,784
- Thanks for hearing me out.
- No, what're you talking about?

651
00:29:18,852 --> 00:29:20,119
What deal?
It's nothing.

652
00:29:20,186 --> 00:29:23,188
I just promised that
I wouldn't...

653
00:29:23,256 --> 00:29:25,891
Do anything stupid
and let him down, and I did.

654
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:27,227
Wait, you let him down?

655
00:29:27,294 --> 00:29:29,496
No, the way I see it,
he let you down.

656
00:29:29,563 --> 00:29:31,030
[Chuckles] What?

657
00:29:31,098 --> 00:29:32,699
He's gotta know
what Louis is capable of,

658
00:29:32,766 --> 00:29:34,233
so if he didn't
listen to what happened

659
00:29:34,301 --> 00:29:35,801
it's 'cause he didn't want to.

660
00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:37,403
Mike, you need to tell him.

661
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:39,238
I don't know how often
you come across Harvey,

662
00:29:39,306 --> 00:29:40,906
but he's not exactly
the listening type.

663
00:29:40,974 --> 00:29:42,775
Right.

664
00:29:42,843 --> 00:29:45,111
But he's also the first person
that would tell you

665
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:47,946
never to take no for an answer
from anyone.

666
00:29:56,289 --> 00:29:58,691
Harvey, how you doing
this fine day?

667
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:01,728
I'm ready to hear
your settlement offer, George.

668
00:30:01,795 --> 00:30:03,497
Cutting to the chase,
I like that.

669
00:30:03,564 --> 00:30:06,934
What's the number?

670
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:09,537
Ten million.

671
00:30:09,605 --> 00:30:12,274
That's half what we spent
developing the prototype.

672
00:30:12,342 --> 00:30:13,809
And ten million
more than you'll get,

673
00:30:13,877 --> 00:30:16,344
the way the wind's blowing.
Yeah, well, winds can change.

674
00:30:16,412 --> 00:30:17,746
And you and I both know
the injunction

675
00:30:17,814 --> 00:30:19,147
will get overturned on appeal.

676
00:30:19,215 --> 00:30:20,549
I don't know
anything of the kind.

677
00:30:20,617 --> 00:30:22,518
Then why are you calling
with an offer at all?

678
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,324
15, that's as high as I'll go.

679
00:30:29,392 --> 00:30:31,927
- Okay, I'm hanging up now.
- 20 million, that's it.

680
00:30:31,995 --> 00:30:34,063
The offer's good for 24 hours.

681
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,631
And I'm sure
I don't have to remind you

682
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:38,467
that you're legally required
to present this to your client.

683
00:30:47,037 --> 00:30:48,638
Is he free?

684
00:30:48,705 --> 00:30:50,406
Not for you.

685
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:51,907
[Sighs]
How much did he tell you?

686
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:55,777
He didn't have to tell me,
I read it on his face.

687
00:30:55,845 --> 00:30:57,445
You heard him.
Maybe he did the same to me.

688
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:02,785
Get in there.

689
00:31:04,521 --> 00:31:07,390
And be careful.

690
00:31:10,861 --> 00:31:12,996
Harvey.

691
00:31:13,064 --> 00:31:15,399
We talked about this, right?
Barging into my office.

692
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:16,867
I'm not leaving
until you hear me out.

693
00:31:16,935 --> 00:31:18,703
- Wanna bet?
- You owe it to me.

694
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,772
- Oh, I owe it to you?
- Yeah.

695
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,273
Look, this is
not my fault, all right?

696
00:31:22,341 --> 00:31:24,041
Louis made me do it.
Louis did, right.

697
00:31:24,109 --> 00:31:25,977
He put a gun to your head
and made you smoke pot.

698
00:31:26,045 --> 00:31:28,179
- Yeah, he did.
He pulled out the drug test--

699
00:31:28,247 --> 00:31:29,680
Which I failed, by the way.

700
00:31:29,748 --> 00:31:31,315
And then he told me
that if I didn't smoke pot

701
00:31:31,383 --> 00:31:34,151
to help him land this
new client, that he'd fire me.

702
00:31:36,754 --> 00:31:37,987
[Sighs] Come on.

703
00:31:38,055 --> 00:31:39,255
It's not so different
than asking someone

704
00:31:39,323 --> 00:31:41,490
out for drinks, is it?
You and I had a deal.

705
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:43,159
I'm sorry.
[Music plays]

706
00:31:43,227 --> 00:31:45,027
And if next time
Louis asks you to do something

707
00:31:45,095 --> 00:31:47,430
that I told you not to do,
what then?

708
00:31:47,497 --> 00:31:49,598
I told you that
I did not have a choice.

709
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:50,699
Oh, because
he had a gun to your head.

710
00:31:50,767 --> 00:31:52,067
- Yes!
- What are your choices

711
00:31:52,135 --> 00:31:53,502
if someone
puts a gun to your head?

712
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,037
What are you talking about?
You do what they say

713
00:31:55,105 --> 00:31:56,438
or they shoot you.
Wrong.

714
00:31:56,506 --> 00:31:58,641
You take the gun,
or you pull out a bigger one,

715
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,142
or you call their bluff.

716
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,844
Or you do any one of
146 other things.

717
00:32:02,912 --> 00:32:04,045
If you can't
think for yourself,

718
00:32:04,113 --> 00:32:05,513
maybe you
aren't cut out for this.

719
00:32:05,581 --> 00:32:07,782
No, I can and I am.
Look, I did what I had to do.

720
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,617
I made the best out
of a bad situation.

721
00:32:09,685 --> 00:32:11,086
Which is what I am good at.

722
00:32:11,153 --> 00:32:12,821
Which is what you hired me
to do in the first place.

723
00:32:12,888 --> 00:32:15,022
Yeah, I hired you
and I expect your loyalty.

724
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,224
So if Louis asks you to do
something like that,

725
00:32:17,292 --> 00:32:19,126
you come to me first.
Oh, right.

726
00:32:19,194 --> 00:32:21,395
Like when I came to you
and you told me

727
00:32:21,462 --> 00:32:22,963
that I couldn't sit
at the adult table, right.

728
00:32:23,031 --> 00:32:25,032
I remember that.
Or-or when you told me

729
00:32:25,099 --> 00:32:26,734
to go file the patent
by myself, like that?

730
00:32:26,802 --> 00:32:28,636
- Excuse me?
- You know what?

731
00:32:28,704 --> 00:32:31,472
Maybe it's time
you showed me some loyalty.

732
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:35,077
Do you know how long it was

733
00:32:35,144 --> 00:32:38,280
before I got
to sit at the adult table?

734
00:32:38,348 --> 00:32:39,749
It was when
I brought in my first client.

735
00:32:39,816 --> 00:32:42,018
Which I don't recall
you having done.

736
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:44,587
And when you screwed up
that patent

737
00:32:44,655 --> 00:32:46,522
and Wyatt
went ape shit on me,

738
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,557
I didn't put that on you,
I took it on myself.

739
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:50,193
Because that's my job.

740
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,862
And it's your job to do
what I say when I say it.

741
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,131
So if you're
talking about loyalty,

742
00:32:55,199 --> 00:32:58,034
you better goddamn earn it.

743
00:33:00,637 --> 00:33:04,207
You're right.

744
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:07,010
I said I'm sorry and
I meant it.

745
00:33:09,013 --> 00:33:10,580
Harvey...

746
00:33:10,648 --> 00:33:13,818
I want you to tr--
I need you to trust me, okay?

747
00:33:13,886 --> 00:33:15,520
And I will
work as long as I can,

748
00:33:15,588 --> 00:33:17,923
as hard as it takes
to make that happen.

749
00:33:17,991 --> 00:33:19,224
[Chuckles] I mean,

750
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:20,392
you don't even
have to pay me, all right?

751
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,795
I'll work for free.

752
00:33:22,862 --> 00:33:25,163
For free.

753
00:33:25,231 --> 00:33:27,232
What, I meant...Not forever.

754
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,767
Just as, like,
a probationary thing.

755
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:30,468
Donna,
tell Wyatt I'm on my way over.

756
00:33:30,536 --> 00:33:31,803
Do you never
have to press a button?

757
00:33:31,871 --> 00:33:33,037
Got it.
And Jessica wants to see

758
00:33:33,105 --> 00:33:34,038
Mike in her office right now.

759
00:33:37,075 --> 00:33:39,443
Louis told me
what you did at the club.

760
00:33:39,511 --> 00:33:40,778
[Sighs]

761
00:33:40,845 --> 00:33:43,047
I bet he didn't
tell you the whole story.

762
00:33:43,114 --> 00:33:45,583
He told me enough
to impress me.

763
00:33:49,689 --> 00:33:52,090
Your new business is hard.

764
00:33:52,158 --> 00:33:53,759
People will
promise you the world

765
00:33:53,826 --> 00:33:55,728
but until they
sign that engagement letter,

766
00:33:55,795 --> 00:33:59,198
it means nothing.

767
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:01,968
Now I don't know
what you told Tom Keller,

768
00:34:02,036 --> 00:34:05,072
but bring a client in
at your age...

769
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,440
That reminds me of Harvey.

770
00:34:08,943 --> 00:34:10,710
Jessica, before we get started,

771
00:34:10,778 --> 00:34:11,778
there's
something in the retainer

772
00:34:11,846 --> 00:34:13,246
that Tom pointed out.

773
00:34:13,313 --> 00:34:14,480
It's not a big deal, really.

774
00:34:14,548 --> 00:34:15,848
- We were just--
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

775
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:17,550
Like I said,
we're here to make you happy.

776
00:34:17,617 --> 00:34:20,486
Right?

777
00:34:24,858 --> 00:34:26,826
I thought you
wanted nothing to do with him?

778
00:34:26,894 --> 00:34:29,028
I didn't.
But then I thought about it.

779
00:34:29,096 --> 00:34:30,697
And he might not
be a very good person,

780
00:34:30,765 --> 00:34:32,299
but a little deviousness

781
00:34:32,366 --> 00:34:34,234
is the sort of thing
you look for in a good lawyer.

782
00:34:34,302 --> 00:34:36,303
I mean, the other guy
I was with, he was too nice.

783
00:34:36,371 --> 00:34:39,006
We were buddies,
we went to school together.

784
00:34:39,074 --> 00:34:40,674
It's time I grew up,
got a real shark.

785
00:34:40,742 --> 00:34:42,877
Well, I had no intention

786
00:34:42,945 --> 00:34:44,679
of being that way
to get your business.

787
00:34:44,747 --> 00:34:47,982
That's exactly why I insisted
that you be my point man.

788
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:50,351
I want someone
being devious for me,

789
00:34:50,419 --> 00:34:51,319
not to me.

790
00:34:53,923 --> 00:34:55,557
What?
It's just...

791
00:34:55,624 --> 00:34:57,859
Louis would've never
told Jessica that I existed,

792
00:34:57,927 --> 00:35:00,095
let alone that I helped him
if you hadn't done that.

793
00:35:00,162 --> 00:35:02,997
Hey, the way I see it,
the three of us stick together,

794
00:35:03,065 --> 00:35:04,198
we'll make a pretty good team.

795
00:35:07,736 --> 00:35:09,404
You know, I got a better idea.

796
00:35:09,471 --> 00:35:10,872
$20 million?

797
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,374
They claim
it's their final offer.

798
00:35:13,442 --> 00:35:15,043
That's what it cost to
make the prototype.

799
00:35:15,111 --> 00:35:19,081
Not to mention my entire savings
and two years of my life.

800
00:35:19,148 --> 00:35:21,015
Wyatt...

801
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:23,518
They know we're stalled
on our injunction.

802
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:26,687
Which means, to them,
they're giving you a fair price

803
00:35:26,755 --> 00:35:29,357
as an insurance policy
against the risk of possibly

804
00:35:29,425 --> 00:35:31,526
losing the interference claim.

805
00:35:31,594 --> 00:35:33,628
I don't care
what it is to them.

806
00:35:33,696 --> 00:35:36,931
It's not fair.

807
00:35:36,999 --> 00:35:39,801
Fair or not,
it's their final offer.

808
00:35:44,006 --> 00:35:47,408
You think I should take it?

809
00:35:47,476 --> 00:35:50,245
I think you should tell them
to shove it up their ass.

810
00:35:53,435 --> 00:35:54,703
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm terribly sorry,

811
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,805
but we have a problem.

812
00:35:56,872 --> 00:35:58,239
What problem?

813
00:35:58,307 --> 00:36:00,074
We came down here
because you led us to believe

814
00:36:00,142 --> 00:36:01,543
that your client
was ready to accept

815
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,778
our settlement agreement.
And I thought he would.

816
00:36:03,846 --> 00:36:05,713
Look, I took him the offer.

817
00:36:05,781 --> 00:36:08,949
I presented it to him,
and recommended that he take it.

818
00:36:09,017 --> 00:36:10,217
In fact,
I urged him to take it.

819
00:36:10,284 --> 00:36:12,052
You know what he told me to do?

820
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,987
He told me to tell you to
shove it up your ass.

821
00:36:15,656 --> 00:36:17,957
[Chuckles]

822
00:36:18,025 --> 00:36:20,393
Now I know you didn't have
me come all the way down here

823
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:21,762
just to tell me that.

824
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:24,432
You're right.
That's not all Wyatt said.

825
00:36:24,499 --> 00:36:26,234
He said rather than
spending years

826
00:36:26,301 --> 00:36:29,004
fighting this out in court,
in 48 hours

827
00:36:29,072 --> 00:36:32,174
he's gonna put this online.

828
00:36:34,145 --> 00:36:36,746
That's a little rough,
but you get the idea.

829
00:36:36,814 --> 00:36:39,116
What are you showing us?
Is this a website?

830
00:36:39,184 --> 00:36:41,785
Available at
the Suntech domain name.

831
00:36:41,853 --> 00:36:44,054
All the design plans and
calculations have been uploaded.

832
00:36:44,122 --> 00:36:45,923
- Is this online now?
- Can be.

833
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:48,425
Which means the whole world
will have access to my designs.

834
00:36:48,493 --> 00:36:50,527
They'll be ten knock-offs
of that phone

835
00:36:50,594 --> 00:36:52,563
before you can catch
a cab back to your headquarters.

836
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,532
- We could file an injunction.
- Not before tomorrow.

837
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,168
And once
that technology is out there,

838
00:36:58,236 --> 00:36:59,636
good luck putting
that genie back in the bottle.

839
00:36:59,704 --> 00:37:01,271
Well, then we'll sue.

840
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:02,940
But my client won't
have any money.

841
00:37:03,008 --> 00:37:05,676
What he will have is credit
for the initial design.

842
00:37:05,744 --> 00:37:08,579
Which, after he incorporates
under a different name,

843
00:37:08,647 --> 00:37:10,514
will be worth
a hell of a lot more money

844
00:37:10,582 --> 00:37:12,283
than the $20 million that
you're offering.

845
00:37:16,455 --> 00:37:19,223
And you're saying that
this was all your client's idea.

846
00:37:22,694 --> 00:37:23,860
Yes.

847
00:37:23,928 --> 00:37:26,963
That's what I'm saying.

848
00:37:29,466 --> 00:37:32,334
[Soft chatter]

849
00:37:40,811 --> 00:37:41,911
Thought you weren't coming.

850
00:37:41,979 --> 00:37:44,547
I had to settle a case first.

851
00:37:44,615 --> 00:37:47,283
You have the paperwork
we talked about?

852
00:37:57,029 --> 00:37:58,963
What is this?

853
00:37:59,031 --> 00:38:01,098
It's a copy of
the judicial conduct codes.

854
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:03,333
A friend of mine works at
the Attorney General's office

855
00:38:03,401 --> 00:38:05,101
gave it to me.
We had a nice chat about you.

856
00:38:05,169 --> 00:38:08,638
I told him if you were willing
to blackmail someone once,

857
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:10,105
chances are
you'd done it before.

858
00:38:10,173 --> 00:38:12,174
He's very anxious to meet you.

859
00:38:12,242 --> 00:38:14,076
You think you can
get away with screwing my wife

860
00:38:14,144 --> 00:38:15,877
and then have me investigated?

861
00:38:15,945 --> 00:38:17,546
You actually have it
the wrong way around.

862
00:38:17,613 --> 00:38:19,748
The only thing I've done so far

863
00:38:19,816 --> 00:38:21,383
is have you investigated.

864
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:23,352
What?

865
00:38:23,419 --> 00:38:25,654
I never
actually slept with Lauren.

866
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:27,523
But I knew
you'd never believe me

867
00:38:27,591 --> 00:38:29,125
so I kept my mouth shut.

868
00:38:29,193 --> 00:38:30,727
But now that
she's getting a divorce,

869
00:38:30,795 --> 00:38:32,429
my policy no longer applies.

870
00:38:32,497 --> 00:38:35,833
And of course, she's free to
date whoever she pleases.

871
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:39,737
And she pleases me.

872
00:38:39,805 --> 00:38:42,639
Enjoy your evening, Donald.

873
00:39:05,197 --> 00:39:07,866
I've always
heard about this place.

874
00:39:07,934 --> 00:39:10,335
Which room is hoffa buried in?

875
00:39:10,402 --> 00:39:12,370
[Chuckles] Not sure, but...

876
00:39:12,438 --> 00:39:16,107
The arc of the covenant's
just down the hall on the left.

877
00:39:16,174 --> 00:39:17,375
When you're finished down here,

878
00:39:17,443 --> 00:39:18,810
I'd like you to come upstairs

879
00:39:18,877 --> 00:39:22,214
and start putting together
a settlement memorandum.

880
00:39:22,281 --> 00:39:24,716
- They went for it?
- Thanks to your idea.

881
00:39:24,784 --> 00:39:27,118
Well, I mean,
it wasn't really my idea--

882
00:39:27,186 --> 00:39:28,419
They're settling for
400 million.

883
00:39:28,487 --> 00:39:29,888
Okay, yeah, that was my idea.

884
00:39:32,425 --> 00:39:34,025
So does this mean
I get to keep my job?

885
00:39:34,093 --> 00:39:35,393
I wanna talk to you about that.

886
00:39:35,461 --> 00:39:37,062
- Before you do, Harvey--
- Do we have to have

887
00:39:37,129 --> 00:39:38,463
a conversation about
how you keep interrupting me?

888
00:39:38,531 --> 00:39:40,499
Um...

889
00:39:40,566 --> 00:39:43,602
Look, sometimes when
someone pulls a gun on you,

890
00:39:43,669 --> 00:39:47,439
instead of bullets
it's filled with blanks.

891
00:39:47,507 --> 00:39:48,874
What's this?

892
00:39:48,941 --> 00:39:50,809
It's a copy of
your drug test results.

893
00:39:50,877 --> 00:39:52,944
But this says I passed.

894
00:39:53,012 --> 00:39:55,681
You did.

895
00:39:55,749 --> 00:39:57,850
Louis showed me a fake?

896
00:39:57,918 --> 00:39:59,151
I'm gonna go
have a talk with him.

897
00:40:01,487 --> 00:40:04,957
You know what,
why don't you let me do it?

898
00:40:05,024 --> 00:40:06,458
You think you're ready
for the adult table?

899
00:40:06,526 --> 00:40:09,428
What, didn't you hear?
I just landed my first client.

900
00:40:09,495 --> 00:40:11,530
Why do you think
I'm showing you this now

901
00:40:11,598 --> 00:40:12,698
and not going straight
to Louis?

902
00:40:16,736 --> 00:40:19,104
Go easy on him.
Nope.

903
00:40:19,172 --> 00:40:21,906
[Softly] Good boy.

904
00:40:24,143 --> 00:40:25,710
You lied.

905
00:40:25,777 --> 00:40:27,345
That other drug test
you showed me was a fake.

906
00:40:27,412 --> 00:40:28,679
How'd you figure that out?

907
00:40:28,746 --> 00:40:30,814
Someone once told me
I have an eye for detail

908
00:40:30,882 --> 00:40:32,449
when it comes
to important paperwork.

909
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:34,284
Well, maybe you're not
as good as you think you are,

910
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:35,819
or you
would've caught it sooner.

911
00:40:35,886 --> 00:40:38,255
Okay, so this was
all some sort of test?

912
00:40:38,322 --> 00:40:40,623
You blackmail me,
you jeopardize my job?

913
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:42,325
Mike, stop.
Stop.

914
00:40:42,392 --> 00:40:44,293
We all came out ahead,
didn't we?

915
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:46,094
That new client's
gonna bring us millions.

916
00:40:46,162 --> 00:40:47,797
Jessica knows your name now.
[Chuckles]

917
00:40:47,864 --> 00:40:49,365
It's a win-win.

918
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:53,968
You're right.

919
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:56,103
She does know my name.

920
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:58,205
Which is why she'll listen
when I tell her

921
00:40:58,273 --> 00:40:59,940
exactly what happened.

922
00:41:01,843 --> 00:41:03,910
Okay, but before you do that

923
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:06,613
it is...That time again,
isn't it?

924
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:08,081
What time?

925
00:41:08,149 --> 00:41:10,750
Pee in a cup time.

926
00:41:10,818 --> 00:41:12,919
[Chuckles] Oh.

927
00:41:12,987 --> 00:41:14,487
And now you know I'd fail.

928
00:41:14,554 --> 00:41:15,721
Of course,
you can run to mommy,

929
00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:17,323
tell her your story,
and take your chances.

930
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,659
Or you can
take the test and trust

931
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,462
that I'll keep it to myself
as my way of thanking you.

932
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:32,441
[Sighs]

933
00:41:32,508 --> 00:41:35,110
[Chuckles]

934
00:41:35,178 --> 00:41:37,646
Ah, you know,
I actually did some reading

935
00:41:37,714 --> 00:41:40,548
of the Pearson-harmon
drug policy as well.

936
00:41:40,616 --> 00:41:43,151
It turns out that you
have to wait three months

937
00:41:43,218 --> 00:41:44,952
before you can
request another drug test.

938
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,921
See, it's a little detail that
you might've missed.

939
00:41:46,989 --> 00:41:49,823
So, drink up.

940
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:53,493
Oh, and I spoke to Tom Keller.

941
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:55,295
He says that he feels
he'd be best served

942
00:41:55,362 --> 00:41:57,597
with a combination of
me and Harvey.

943
00:41:57,665 --> 00:42:00,400
I think you'll get
that call in the morning.
