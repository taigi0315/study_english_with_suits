--------------------------------------------------
1. [00:24:06.790000-00:24:08.030000] and you know what I tell him?
Clifford Watkins?
2. [00:24:08.090000-00:24:09.700000] Excuse me.
3. [00:24:09.760000-00:24:10.760000] Can I help you?
4. [00:24:10.830000-00:24:12.500000] Jonathan atwater.
5. [00:24:12.570000-00:24:14.130000] I work for Dean wormer
in the admissions office.
6. [00:24:14.200000-00:24:16.400000] Yes, of course.
What can I do for you?
7. [00:24:16.470000-00:24:18.170000] Well, the Dean
personally sent me down here
8. [00:24:18.240000-00:24:20.470000] to invite you
to a small cocktail hour
9. [00:24:20.540000-00:24:24.510000] for some of
our more realistic candidates.
10. [00:24:24.580000-00:24:26.810000] And we'd like to keep
this sort of thing discreet,
11. [00:24:26.880000-00:24:29.080000] so if you'd subtly hand me
your name tag,
12. [00:24:29.150000-00:24:32.380000] you can proceed
directly to the Dean's office.
13. [00:24:32.450000-00:24:34.350000] Congratulations.
14. [00:24:38.260000-00:24:40.490000] Harvard law
is the oldest law school
15. [00:24:40.560000-00:24:42.160000] in the country and boasts
16. [00:24:42.230000-00:24:44.700000] the most successful graduates
in the world.
17. [00:24:44.760000-00:24:47.930000] Currently, we are six
of nine supreme court justices
18. [00:24:48-00:24:50.540000] and, of course, the president
of the United States.
19. [00:25:40.680000-00:25:42.350000] Uh, hi, good morning.
20. [00:25:42.420000-00:25:43.380000] I'm here to see--
Have a seat.
21. [00:25:49.890000-00:25:52.390000] Thank you.
22. [00:26:09.710000-00:26:11.140000] Mike Ross?
23. [00:26:11.210000-00:26:13.340000] Hi, I'm Rachel Zane.
24. [00:26:13.410000-00:26:15.410000] I'll be giving you
your orientation.
25. [00:26:15.480000-00:26:18.550000] - Wow. You're pretty.
- Good. You've hit on me.
26. [00:26:18.620000-00:26:20.950000] We can get it out of the way
that I am not interested.
27. [00:26:21.020000-00:26:22.090000] No, I'm sorry.
I wasn't hitting on you.
28. [00:26:22.150000-00:26:23.150000] Trust me.
29. [00:26:23.220000-00:26:24.760000] I've given dozens of these,
30. [00:26:24.820000-00:26:26.690000] and without fail,
whatever new hotshot it is
31. [00:26:26.760000-00:26:28.060000] thinks that,
because I'm just a paralegal,
32. [00:26:28.130000-00:26:29.830000] that I will
somehow be blown away
33. [00:26:29.890000-00:26:31.260000] by his dazzling degree.
34. [00:26:31.330000-00:26:33.560000] Let me assure you, I won't.
35. [00:26:33.630000-00:26:37.100000] I was.
I was hitting on you.
36. [00:26:37.170000-00:26:38.940000] You were.
Take notes.
37. [00:26:39.010000-00:26:40.210000] I'm not gonna repeat myself.
38. [00:26:40.270000-00:26:43.580000] I love you.
39. [00:26:43.640000-00:26:46.610000] The firm operates
on a chain of command model.
40. [00:26:46.680000-00:26:48.220000] Harvey's
your commanding officer.
41. [00:26:48.280000-00:26:50.080000] However, Louis Litt,
he oversees all associates,
42. [00:26:50.150000-00:26:51.720000] so you'll also answer to him.
43. [00:26:51.790000-00:26:53.520000] What do you think about Harvey?
44. [00:26:53.590000-00:26:55.290000] People are in awe of him.
45. [00:26:55.360000-00:26:57.020000] They say he's the best closer
there is,
46. [00:26:57.090000-00:26:58.360000] but I have very little contact
with him,
47. [00:26:58.430000-00:26:59.560000] so I don't know.
48. [00:26:59.630000-00:27:01.930000] And what about Louis Litt?
49. [00:27:02-00:27:07.070000] Let's continue with your tour.
50. [00:27:07.130000-00:27:09.300000] Hey, Becky.
You are glowing.
51. [00:27:09.370000-00:27:10.900000] I wonder why that is.
Oh, yeah.
52. [00:27:10.970000-00:27:13.240000] It's the day
they announce my promotion.
53. [00:27:13.310000-00:27:14.810000] Jimmy, have you lost weight?
54. [00:27:14.880000-00:27:16.940000] Steve-O.
55. [00:27:17.010000-00:27:19.680000] Looking like a guy
who came to work.
56. [00:27:19.750000-00:27:21.980000] Excuse me,
why are you scratching off
57. [00:27:22.050000-00:27:23.320000] the senior off my door?
58. [00:27:23.390000-00:27:25.320000] I got a work order
to take it off.
59. [00:27:25.390000-00:27:27.320000] - Who issued the work order?
- My supervisor.
60. [00:27:27.390000-00:27:29.320000] Why did he issue
the work order?
61. [00:27:29.390000-00:27:31.330000] If I knew that,
I'd be his supervisor.
62. [00:27:31.390000-00:27:33.190000] You seem
to be enjoying yourself.
63. [00:27:33.260000-00:27:35.600000] I haven't enjoyed myself
since 2004.
64. [00:27:35.670000-00:27:37.430000] Donna!
65. [00:27:37.500000-00:27:40] Someone's trying to have
a little fun with me here.
66. [00:27:40.070000-00:27:42.700000] Jessica wants to see you
in her office.
67. [00:27:42.770000-00:27:44.470000] Now.
68. [00:27:44.540000-00:27:50.340000] And finally,
this is where you'll live.
69. [00:27:50.410000-00:27:52.180000] Wow.
70. [00:27:52.250000-00:27:54.350000] I gave you that for a reason.
You haven't taken one note.
71. [00:27:54.420000-00:27:55.580000] - That's because--
- Because you were
72. [00:27:55.650000-00:27:57.220000] too busy ogling me to listen
73. [00:27:57.290000-00:27:58.520000] to a word I've said?
74. [00:28:01.220000-00:28:03.020000] Partners' offices
anchor the wings.
75. [00:28:03.090000-00:28:05.660000] Fifth floor's research,
sixth is security.
76. [00:28:05.730000-00:28:08.360000] All work gets billed,
even if it's finding an address.
77. [00:28:08.430000-00:28:09.730000] I answer to Harvey
78. [00:28:09.800000-00:28:11.400000] and Louis Litt,
and, judging by the way
79. [00:28:11.470000-00:28:13.170000] you responded to my questions,
80. [00:28:13.240000-00:28:15.840000] I should admire Harvey
and I should fear Louis.
81. [00:28:15.910000-00:28:17.540000] You have been here
for five years,
82. [00:28:17.610000-00:28:18.970000] and just because I outrank you
83. [00:28:19.040000-00:28:20.140000] does not mean
I have the authority
84. [00:28:20.210000-00:28:21.380000] to command your services.
85. [00:28:21.450000-00:28:22.810000] Oh, it's also pretty clear
86. [00:28:22.880000-00:28:24.250000] that you think you're too smart
87. [00:28:24.310000-00:28:25.380000] to be a paralegal.
88. [00:28:25.450000-00:28:27.750000] You know what nobody likes?
89. [00:28:27.820000-00:28:29.490000] Nobody likes a showoff.
90. [00:28:29.550000-00:28:32.860000] You used the word "ogling."
91. [00:28:32.920000-00:28:35.030000] When do I get to see Harvey?
92. [00:28:35.090000-00:28:37.330000] Gerald Tate fired the firm.
93. [00:28:37.400000-00:28:39.530000] So you're taking
my promotion away.
94. [00:28:39.600000-00:28:42.400000] You know, most firms would put
you in front of the bar
95. [00:28:42.470000-00:28:44.030000] and have your license stripped.
96. [00:28:44.100000-00:28:45.840000] You lied to a client,
and he figured it out.
97. [00:28:45.900000-00:28:48.240000] I lied to him to get him
to do the right thing
98. [00:28:48.310000-00:28:49.810000] and honor his goddamn contract.
99. [00:28:49.880000-00:28:51.080000] And you didn't seem
to mind so much
100. [00:28:51.140000-00:28:52.380000] when you thought
I got away with it.
101. [00:28:52.440000-00:28:54.580000] But you didn't get away
with it.
102. [00:28:54.650000-00:28:57.020000] And I can't justify handing you
a promotion
103. [00:28:57.080000-00:28:58.380000] on the same day that you lose
a huge client.
104. [00:28:58.450000-00:29:01.020000] One client doesn't make a firm.
105. [00:29:01.090000-00:29:02.520000] I don't know if you've noticed,
106. [00:29:02.590000-00:29:04.890000] but we're in the middle
of an economic meltdown.
107. [00:29:04.960000-00:29:06.330000] Companies
aren't exactly lining up
108. [00:29:06.390000-00:29:08.190000] to spend money
on attorneys right now.
109. [00:29:08.260000-00:29:11.300000] And, you know, Gerald might
have forgiven the lying
110. [00:29:11.360000-00:29:13.630000] had you not humiliated him.
111. [00:29:13.700000-00:29:16.100000] But you did,
and you need to accept that.
112. [00:29:19.270000-00:29:22.170000] Jessica, if you hadn't done
as much for me as you have,
113. [00:29:22.240000-00:29:24.210000] I'd be heading for the door.
114. [00:29:24.280000-00:29:26.940000] If I hadn't done as much
for you as I have,
115. [00:29:27.010000-00:29:28.810000] I'd be throwing you
out the window.
116. [00:29:28.880000-00:29:32.920000] But, Harvey,
no more shenanigans.
117. [00:29:32.980000-00:29:35.820000] You do one more thing
that isn't straight as an arrow,
118. [00:29:35.890000-00:29:37.890000] and instead
of covering your ass,
119. [00:29:37.960000-00:29:39.420000] I will put you
in front of the bar myself.
120. [00:29:43.230000-00:29:45.130000] - Mike.
- Hey.
121. [00:29:45.200000-00:29:47.700000] Who's ready
for a great first day?
122. [00:29:47.770000-00:29:49.600000] I'm gonna have to let you go.
123. [00:29:49.670000-00:29:50.640000] - What?
- I just got reamed
124. [00:29:50.700000-00:29:52.240000] for lying to a client,
125. [00:29:52.310000-00:29:53.910000] and if they find out
that I lied about you
126. [00:29:53.970000-00:29:55.240000] going to Harvard,
they'll take away my license.
127. [00:29:55.310000-00:29:56.510000] You what?
128. [00:29:56.580000-00:29:59.080000] Not now, Donna.
129. [00:29:59.150000-00:30:00.650000] Look, I have to put
my own interests
130. [00:30:00.710000-00:30:02.150000] above yours.
It's nothing personal.
131. [00:30:02.210000-00:30:04.750000] You're fired.
132. [00:30:04.820000-00:30:08.220000] Wait, so you're worried
that if I stay,
133. [00:30:08.290000-00:30:11.560000] then they might find out
that you lied about me
134. [00:30:11.620000-00:30:13.960000] and you'll lose your license.
135. [00:30:14.030000-00:30:16.230000] But if you fire me,
then I could tell them
136. [00:30:16.300000-00:30:17.860000] that you lied about me,
137. [00:30:17.930000-00:30:19.430000] and you'd definitely lose
your license.
138. [00:30:19.500000-00:30:22.070000] Are you telling me that
139. [00:30:22.140000-00:30:23.600000] if I throw you under the bus,
140. [00:30:23.670000-00:30:25.040000] you're gonna drag me with you?
141. [00:30:25.110000-00:30:27.070000] You put your interests
above mine,
142. [00:30:27.140000-00:30:30.640000] and I'm just putting mine
back up next to yours.
143. [00:30:32.780000-00:30:33.850000] You're rehired.
144. [00:30:36.350000-00:30:38.650000] So should I--
all right.
145. [00:30:38.720000-00:30:41.190000] Here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna give me back
146. [00:30:41.250000-00:30:42.550000] my promotion,
and that's the last
147. [00:30:42.620000-00:30:43.720000] we're gonna talk about this.
148. [00:30:43.790000-00:30:45.420000] And why is that?
149. [00:30:45.490000-00:30:47.260000] Because if you don't,
I'm gonna go across town
150. [00:30:47.330000-00:30:49.090000] and join Rick Peterson.
151. [00:30:49.160000-00:30:51.060000] I'm gonna approach every client
I've ever closed,
152. [00:30:51.130000-00:30:52.930000] and I'm gonna
take them with me.
153. [00:30:53-00:30:54.730000] You do that,
and you'll force me
154. [00:30:54.800000-00:30:56.300000] to put you in front
of the ethics board.
155. [00:30:56.370000-00:30:58.040000] - I don't think you will.
- And why not?
156. [00:30:58.100000-00:30:59.670000] Because you were obligated
to notify them
157. [00:30:59.740000-00:31:01.810000] the second I lied to Gerald,
but you didn't.
158. [00:31:01.880000-00:31:03.580000] You put me in front
of the board right now,
159. [00:31:03.640000-00:31:04.910000] I'll put you right up there
with me.
160. [00:31:04.980000-00:31:07.480000] Hmm.
161. [00:31:11.850000-00:31:15.890000] I'll...I'll give you
your promotion.
162. [00:31:15.960000-00:31:17.660000] But you have to do something
for me.
163. [00:31:17.730000-00:31:18.890000] Anything.
164. [00:31:18.960000-00:31:21.230000] Ah.
Pro Bono.
165. [00:31:21.300000-00:31:22.330000] Anything but that.
166. [00:31:22.400000-00:31:23.900000] Harvey, Pro Bono cases
167. [00:31:23.970000-00:31:25.740000] are how we, as a firm,
show that we care
168. [00:31:25.800000-00:31:27.270000] about more than just ourselves.
169. [00:31:27.340000-00:31:29.540000] I'm not saying
we shouldn't do them.
170. [00:31:29.610000-00:31:31.040000] I'm saying I shouldn't do them.
171. [00:31:31.110000-00:31:32.610000] And it's how you can show me
172. [00:31:32.680000-00:31:35.110000] that you care about more
than just yourself.
173. [00:31:35.180000-00:31:37.410000] You'll handle this yourself.
174. [00:31:37.480000-00:31:38.780000] You will not pass it off.
175. [00:31:38.850000-00:31:41.380000] Absolutely.
176. [00:31:44.390000-00:31:45.790000] Your first case.
177. [00:31:45.860000-00:31:46.820000] Awesome.
What is it?
178. [00:31:46.890000-00:31:47.830000] Pro Bono.
179. [00:31:47.890000-00:31:49.430000] Sexual harassment.
180. [00:31:49.490000-00:31:51.530000] Don't tell anyone
I laid it off on you,
181. [00:31:51.600000-00:31:53.360000] and don't screw it up.
Got it.
182. [00:31:53.430000-00:31:56.400000] You can't handle it.
I'll knock it out of the park.
183. [00:31:56.470000-00:31:58.500000] Easy, Clarence Thomas.
Just go meet the client.
184. [00:31:58.570000-00:32:01.610000] Hey. Didn't I tell you
to get some better suits?
185. [00:32:01.680000-00:32:03.710000] I spent $500.
186. [00:32:03.780000-00:32:05.650000] For how many suits?
187. [00:32:05.710000-00:32:07.950000] Five.
188. [00:32:08.020000-00:32:09.350000] What?
189. [00:32:09.420000-00:32:10.950000] Nancy?
190. [00:32:11.020000-00:32:12.620000] - Mike?
- Yeah, hi.
191. [00:32:14.860000-00:32:16.920000] You're a kid.
192. [00:32:16.990000-00:32:18.990000] No, I'm a--
I'm a grown man.
193. [00:32:19.060000-00:32:21.790000] You're so skinny.
Have a grape.
194. [00:32:21.860000-00:32:24.500000] Thank you.
195. [00:32:24.560000-00:32:26.530000] Why don't you tell me
your story?
196. [00:32:26.600000-00:32:28.230000] It started two years ago.
197. [00:32:28.300000-00:32:29.700000] I was a stay-at-home mom
198. [00:32:29.770000-00:32:31.670000] to my son, Freddie.
199. [00:32:31.740000-00:32:33.570000] And one day
we were at little league,
200. [00:32:33.640000-00:32:35.210000] Freddie was five.
201. [00:32:35.270000-00:32:36.640000] He really hated
that he couldn't play
202. [00:32:36.710000-00:32:38.040000] with the older kids.
203. [00:32:38.110000-00:32:40.610000] It was the third inning,
and I got a phone call.
204. [00:32:40.680000-00:32:41.950000] My husband had been
in a car accident,
205. [00:32:42.010000-00:32:45.010000] and he was gone,
just like that.
206. [00:32:45.080000-00:32:47.380000] I'm so sorry.
207. [00:32:47.450000-00:32:50.490000] I did the best I could.
208. [00:32:50.560000-00:32:52.360000] I got myself a job
as a secretary
209. [00:32:52.420000-00:32:53.720000] at Devlin McGreggor.
210. [00:32:53.790000-00:32:54.990000] And I even got promoted
211. [00:32:55.060000-00:32:56.260000] to secretary of the president,
212. [00:32:56.330000-00:32:58.360000] Charles Hunt.
213. [00:32:58.430000-00:33:01.500000] And that's when it all changed.
214. [00:33:01.570000-00:33:03.900000] It's okay.
Tell me what happened.
215. [00:33:03.970000-00:33:06.140000] He started asking me
to stay late,
216. [00:33:06.210000-00:33:09.310000] order in dinners together,
stuff like that.
217. [00:33:09.380000-00:33:11.680000] One night, he says
that if I sleep with him,
218. [00:33:11.750000-00:33:13.110000] he's gonna take care of me
in the firm,
219. [00:33:13.180000-00:33:15.710000] and, if I don't,
he's gonna fire me.
220. [00:33:15.780000-00:33:16.950000] So what did you do?
221. [00:33:17.020000-00:33:18.280000] I went to human resources.
222. [00:33:18.350000-00:33:20.250000] They said they investigated,
223. [00:33:20.320000-00:33:22.720000] couldn't find anything
to support my claim.
224. [00:33:22.790000-00:33:24.260000] Two months later, I was fired
225. [00:33:24.330000-00:33:26.030000] for poor job performance.
226. [00:33:26.090000-00:33:27.700000] They wouldn't let me
say good-bye to anybody.
227. [00:33:27.760000-00:33:30.060000] They wouldn't write me
a letter of recommendation.
228. [00:33:30.130000-00:33:31.730000] I wasn't looking for a payoff.
229. [00:33:31.800000-00:33:34.200000] All I wanted
was for it to stop.
230. [00:33:34.270000-00:33:36.140000] Can you help me?
231. [00:33:36.200000-00:33:39.140000] Uh, yes.
232. [00:33:39.210000-00:33:41.540000] Yes, I can.
233. [00:33:41.610000-00:33:43.080000] What do you need my help for?
234. [00:33:43.140000-00:33:45.180000] - Wait, can I just--
- No, give me the update.
235. [00:33:45.250000-00:33:47.480000] You know, she's a nice woman.
236. [00:33:47.550000-00:33:48.920000] She--
On the case.
237. [00:33:48.980000-00:33:50.380000] I don't get
emotionally attached
238. [00:33:50.450000-00:33:51.780000] to the client.
239. [00:33:51.850000-00:33:53.590000] This woman had
her life ripped apart.
240. [00:33:53.660000-00:33:55.190000] You don't even care?
241. [00:33:55.260000-00:33:56.890000] I'm not about caring.
I'm about winning.
242. [00:33:56.960000-00:33:58.760000] Why can't you be about both?
243. [00:33:58.830000-00:34:00.330000] I'd explain it to you,
244. [00:34:00.400000-00:34:03.630000] but then I'd have
to care about you.
245. [00:34:03.700000-00:34:05.270000] What are you doing?
246. [00:34:05.330000-00:34:06.500000] Don't touch that.
247. [00:34:06.570000-00:34:08.270000] I'm just checking my lock.
248. [00:34:08.340000-00:34:11.440000] You ride your bike to...
249. [00:34:11.510000-00:34:12.470000] It's locked, okay?
250. [00:34:12.540000-00:34:14.080000] Come on.
251. [00:34:19.150000-00:34:21.050000] Defense sent over
the investigation files
252. [00:34:21.120000-00:34:22.650000] as a courtesy.
No, they didn't.
253. [00:34:22.720000-00:34:24.120000] Nobody does anything
as a courtesy.
254. [00:34:24.190000-00:34:25.750000] They sent those files
255. [00:34:25.820000-00:34:26.960000] because that's
where they want you to look.
256. [00:34:27.020000-00:34:28.260000] Listen, being a lawyer's
257. [00:34:28.320000-00:34:30.230000] like being a doctor.
258. [00:34:30.290000-00:34:31.630000] You mean how you don't get
emotional about the client?
259. [00:34:31.690000-00:34:33.830000] No, I mean you keep pressing
until it hurts.
260. [00:34:33.900000-00:34:35.330000] Then you know where to look.
261. [00:34:35.400000-00:34:37.070000] Forget about impeaching
the investigation.
262. [00:34:37.130000-00:34:38.870000] It won't lead anywhere.
No employee's gonna testify
263. [00:34:38.940000-00:34:40.370000] against their own CEO.
Okay.
264. [00:34:40.440000-00:34:42.240000] So what do you suggest I do?
265. [00:34:42.310000-00:34:44.310000] Think.
This guy's done this once...
266. [00:34:44.370000-00:34:46.110000] He's done it before.
267. [00:34:46.180000-00:34:47.540000] And if the people
who work for him now
268. [00:34:47.610000-00:34:49.040000] won't testify against him...
269. [00:34:49.110000-00:34:51.650000] Someone who used
to work for him might.
270. [00:34:51.710000-00:34:53.150000] You know what,
271. [00:34:53.220000-00:34:54.850000] I'd subpoena
the personnel records
272. [00:34:54.920000-00:34:56.380000] of every woman
who's left the firm
273. [00:34:56.450000-00:34:57.950000] during this guy's tenure.
That's funny.
274. [00:34:58.020000-00:34:59.550000] That's exactly what I thought.
275. [00:34:59.620000-00:35:01.090000] Then what do you need
my help for?
276. [00:35:01.160000-00:35:03.560000] I don't know
how to fill out a subpoena.
277. [00:35:03.630000-00:35:08.430000] Figure it out yourself.
278. [00:35:08.500000-00:35:10.630000] Donna, can you show me
how to fill out a subpoena?
279. [00:35:10.700000-00:35:12.200000] Absolutely.
And after that,
280. [00:35:12.270000-00:35:13.740000] you want me to show you
how to wipe your ass?
281. [00:35:13.800000-00:35:14.800000] It's funny,
because you should already know
282. [00:35:14.870000-00:35:16.170000] how to do both those things.
283. [00:35:16.240000-00:35:18.070000] Ha, yeah, that's hilarious.
284. [00:35:18.140000-00:35:20.180000] What's that?
That's my suit guy.
285. [00:35:20.240000-00:35:22.380000] Go in, tell him I sent you,
and spend some money.
286. [00:35:22.440000-00:35:24.810000] What does it matter
how much money I spend on suits?
287. [00:35:24.880000-00:35:26.420000] People respond
to how we're dressed,
288. [00:35:26.480000-00:35:27.980000] so like it or not,
this is what you have to do.
289. [00:35:28.050000-00:35:29.990000] That's weird,
you giving me advice.
290. [00:35:30.050000-00:35:32.420000] It sounds like you actually care
about me.
291. [00:35:32.490000-00:35:34.290000] I don't.
You're a reflection of me,
292. [00:35:34.360000-00:35:36.090000] and I absolutely care about me.
293. [00:35:36.160000-00:35:38.430000] So get your skinny tie
out of my face and get to work.
294. [00:35:41.130000-00:35:42.730000] That was a little harsh.
295. [00:35:42.800000-00:35:44.300000] Really?
296. [00:35:44.370000-00:35:47.070000] Yeah.
297. [00:35:53.140000-00:35:55.240000] Mike.
298. [00:35:55.310000-00:35:57.310000] Where are you going?
299. [00:35:57.380000-00:36:00.010000] It's 6:30.
I'm going home.
300. [00:36:01.320000-00:36:02.850000] Okay.
What's so funny?
301. [00:36:02.920000-00:36:04.480000] You're a rookie associate.
302. [00:36:04.550000-00:36:07.020000] If you go home before 9:00
on your first week,
303. [00:36:07.090000-00:36:09.160000] you're not gonna make it
through your first month.
304. [00:36:09.220000-00:36:10.620000] And Louis Litt
wants to see you.
305. [00:36:10.690000-00:36:12.630000] - Hey, can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.
306. [00:36:12.690000-00:36:15.160000] This tie, is it too skinny?
307. [00:36:15.230000-00:36:16.400000] Yeah.
308. [00:36:16.460000-00:36:19.470000] Right.
309. [00:36:19.530000-00:36:21.430000] Yeah.
310. [00:36:29.140000-00:36:31.240000] I know you had orientation
from Rachel,
311. [00:36:31.310000-00:36:35.120000] but I wanted to give you
a special welcome from me.
312. [00:36:35.180000-00:36:39.450000] Amongst other things,
I'm sort of the disciplinarian
313. [00:36:39.520000-00:36:40.450000] of the associates.
314. [00:36:44.190000-00:36:45.760000] - You wanted to see me?
- Yes.
315. [00:36:45.830000-00:36:48.230000] Gary, please come in.
Mike, this is Gary Lipsky.
316. [00:36:48.300000-00:36:50.160000] Gary's one of our most promising
associates from last year.
317. [00:36:50.230000-00:36:51.930000] Hi.
318. [00:36:52-00:36:54.700000] Gary, Ms. Pearson
wanted me to ask,
319. [00:36:54.770000-00:36:56.240000] have you completed
the petramco filing?
320. [00:36:56.300000-00:36:57.940000] Well, my brother was in
over the weekend,
321. [00:36:58.010000-00:36:59.140000] so I didn't really get to it.
322. [00:36:59.210000-00:37:00.910000] Look, I mean, Gary, come on.
323. [00:37:00.980000-00:37:02.080000] This is, like, the third time
I've had to ask.
324. [00:37:02.140000-00:37:03.540000] I'll get right on it.
325. [00:37:03.610000-00:37:05.310000] Don't bother.
You're fired.
326. [00:37:05.380000-00:37:07.250000] What?
You can't fire me.
327. [00:37:07.320000-00:37:08.880000] Oh, yes, I can.
And I just did.
328. [00:37:08.950000-00:37:11.580000] Go pack up your things.
329. [00:37:11.650000-00:37:13.820000] Don't you ever show your face
in this place again.
330. [00:37:20.390000-00:37:23.060000] See, I arranged
for you to see that
331. [00:37:23.130000-00:37:25.600000] because we pay our associates
very well
332. [00:37:25.670000-00:37:28.440000] and we provide the opportunity
for unlimited advancement.
333. [00:37:28.500000-00:37:31.940000] But in return
we expect results.
334. [00:37:34.440000-00:37:36.650000] Have I made myself clear?
335. [00:37:36.710000-00:37:38.880000] Yeah.
336. [00:37:40.920000-00:37:42.790000] Great.
337. [00:37:42.850000-00:37:44.890000] Welcome to Pearson Hardman.
338. [00:37:50.030000-00:37:53.260000] Feel free to go back to work.
339. [00:37:55.870000-00:37:57.900000] Harvey.
340. [00:37:57.970000-00:38:01.040000] Okay, I have two words for you.
341. [00:38:01.100000-00:38:03.740000] Absolutely beautiful.
342. [00:38:03.810000-00:38:06.240000] You think you're the only one
who can charm a client?
343. [00:38:06.310000-00:38:09.080000] Categorically stunning.
344. [00:38:09.140000-00:38:11.110000] How's the new kid working out?
345. [00:38:11.180000-00:38:13.280000] Regally hot.
346. [00:38:13.350000-00:38:15.980000] - You're an idiot.
- Jessica Pearson.
347. [00:38:16.050000-00:38:18.050000] Good night, Harvey.
348. [00:38:25.900000-00:38:27.060000] What are you doing here?
349. [00:38:27.130000-00:38:29.570000] Watching <i>sportscenter.</i>
350. [00:38:29.630000-00:38:32.230000] Boo-yah.
351. [00:38:32.300000-00:38:33.640000] You won't return
my phone calls.
352. [00:38:33.700000-00:38:35.800000] Ah, yeah,
because you set me up.
353. [00:38:35.870000-00:38:38.040000] Do you remember that?
You think I knew about that?
354. [00:38:38.110000-00:38:40.810000] Here we go.
Round 50 of I get the shaft
355. [00:38:40.880000-00:38:43.010000] because you didn't know
the whole story.
356. [00:38:43.080000-00:38:44.810000] You knew there were risks
when you quoted that crap
357. [00:38:44.880000-00:38:46.080000] from that book.
358. [00:38:46.150000-00:38:47.720000] Okay, you needed money,
359. [00:38:47.780000-00:38:49.120000] and I came through
with an opportunity
360. [00:38:49.190000-00:38:50.990000] like always.
361. [00:38:51.050000-00:38:52.050000] Besides, you weren't
the only one who got screwed.
362. [00:38:52.120000-00:38:53.460000] They pulled a gun on me.
363. [00:38:53.520000-00:38:54.560000] Oh, really?
364. [00:38:54.630000-00:38:55.930000] And why did they do that?
365. [00:38:55.990000-00:38:57.190000] To keep me from warning you.
366. [00:38:57.260000-00:38:58.860000] So you did know.
367. [00:38:58.930000-00:39:00.360000] Well, not until
after it was too late.
368. [00:39:00.430000-00:39:01.960000] Well, it's too late now.
369. [00:39:02.030000-00:39:03.800000] Look, let me make it up to you.
370. [00:39:03.870000-00:39:05.470000] Oh, you want
to make it up to me?
371. [00:39:05.540000-00:39:08.370000] Give me my key back.
372. [00:39:15.210000-00:39:17.950000] Michael.
373. [00:39:18.010000-00:39:20.050000] Come on.
374. [00:39:20.120000-00:39:21.280000] You know I don't want
to live in a world
375. [00:39:21.350000-00:39:23.490000] where we're not tight.
376. [00:39:24.650000-00:39:27.290000] Then kill yourself.
377. [00:39:27.360000-00:39:28.890000] Get out.
378. [00:39:30.530000-00:39:33.530000] Get the hell out.
379. [00:39:57.810000-00:39:59.290000] Donna, I need the--
380. [00:39:59.390000-00:40:01.090000] oh, also I didn't have
a chance to--
381. [00:40:01.150000-00:40:02.720000] marry me?
- I took care of that too.
382. [00:40:02.790000-00:40:04.390000] We've been married
for the last seven years.
383. [00:40:04.460000-00:40:06.490000] Excellent.
384. [00:40:06.850000-00:40:09.570000] Umm, Devlin McGreggor's
fighting the subpoena.
385. [00:40:09.600000-00:40:11.390000] They filed a motion
to dismiss the case
386. [00:40:11.420000-00:40:12.720000] based on our lack of evidence.
387. [00:40:12.740000-00:40:13.700000] - Good.
- Good.
388. [00:40:13.770000-00:40:15.270000] Wait, what do you mean, "good"?
389. [00:40:15.330000-00:40:16.700000] They don't want
to hand over the files.
390. [00:40:16.770000-00:40:18.170000] You pressed where it hurt.
391. [00:40:18.240000-00:40:19.710000] You're looking
in the right place.
392. [00:40:19.770000-00:40:20.940000] Did you think
they wouldn't fight back?
393. [00:40:21.010000-00:40:22.670000] Well, I--
now that you mention it.
394. [00:40:22.740000-00:40:24.140000] Oh, my bad.
395. [00:40:24.210000-00:40:25.510000] I keep forgetting
396. [00:40:25.580000-00:40:26.910000] you don't
actually know anything.
397. [00:40:26.980000-00:40:28.610000] - The idea is,
398. [00:40:28.680000-00:40:30.420000] you make a move,
they make a move.
399. [00:40:30.480000-00:40:32.080000] You go back and forth
until one of you wins.
400. [00:40:32.150000-00:40:33.690000] Okay, what if they win
the motion
401. [00:40:33.750000-00:40:35.550000] and the case gets dismissed?
402. [00:40:35.620000-00:40:37.920000] You're not as good
as you think you are.
403. [00:40:39.730000-00:40:41.060000] Harvey.
What a coincidence.
404. [00:40:41.130000-00:40:42.730000] I was wondering
how the Pro Bono was coming.
405. [00:40:42.800000-00:40:43.800000] I'm all over it.
406. [00:40:43.860000-00:40:45.100000] That makes me very happy,
407. [00:40:45.160000-00:40:46.730000] because if I were to find out
408. [00:40:46.800000-00:40:47.970000] that you weren't putting in
your full effort,
409. [00:40:48.030000-00:40:49.230000] I'd be very upset.
410. [00:40:49.300000-00:40:51.640000] No worries.
We're all good.
411. [00:41:00.250000-00:41:02.380000] Rachel! Rachel, Rachel,
Rachel. I need your help.
412. [00:41:02.450000-00:41:03.750000] There's a hearing
on my subpoena.
413. [00:41:03.820000-00:41:05.320000] I've got three cases
in front of you,
414. [00:41:05.380000-00:41:06.320000] so you're gonna have
to wait in line.
415. [00:41:06.390000-00:41:07.390000] No. No, no, no.
416. [00:41:07.450000-00:41:08.990000] My hearing is tomorrow.
417. [00:41:09.050000-00:41:10.320000] So why are you coming to me?
418. [00:41:10.390000-00:41:13.120000] Because Donna says
419. [00:41:13.190000-00:41:14.530000] you're the best researcher
in the firm.
420. [00:41:14.590000-00:41:17.500000] Let me see the motion.
421. [00:41:17.560000-00:41:19.870000] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
422. [00:41:19.930000-00:41:21.670000] You have an office?
423. [00:41:21.730000-00:41:24.400000] How do you have an office
and I have a cubicle?
424. [00:41:24.470000-00:41:26.600000] Like you said,
I'm the best researcher
425. [00:41:26.670000-00:41:28.440000] in the firm.
Really?
426. [00:41:28.510000-00:41:30.010000] I just made that up.
427. [00:41:30.080000-00:41:32.480000] I didn't even have time
to talk to Donna.
428. [00:41:32.540000-00:41:35.550000] Is this all a joke to you?
429. [00:41:35.610000-00:41:36.750000] 'Cause I take my job seriously.
430. [00:41:36.810000-00:41:38.220000] No, I'm sorry.
431. [00:41:38.280000-00:41:40.650000] Look, I was--
432. [00:41:40.720000-00:41:43.120000] look, you weren't there, okay.
433. [00:41:43.190000-00:41:45.490000] I care about this woman.
434. [00:41:45.560000-00:41:47.630000] She's got
nowhere else to turn--
435. [00:41:47.690000-00:41:49.130000] - and you can't help her
by yourself.
436. [00:41:49.200000-00:41:51.430000] I can.
437. [00:41:51.500000-00:41:54.330000] I just prefer not to.
438. [00:41:54.400000-00:41:57.840000] Okay.
439. [00:41:57.910000-00:41:59.240000] You're asking to look
at private files
440. [00:41:59.310000-00:42:00.670000] without any evidence
of your assertion.
441. [00:42:00.740000-00:42:01.840000] Yeah, but the only way
that we can find
442. [00:42:01.910000-00:42:03.640000] the evidence is to look
at those files.
443. [00:42:03.710000-00:42:04.640000] It's a rickety argument.
444. [00:42:04.710000-00:42:06.810000] But is there a precedent?
445. [00:42:06.880000-00:42:10.620000] Let's go see
if we can find one.
446. [00:42:10.680000-00:42:13.190000] Research is as much art
as science,
447. [00:42:13.250000-00:42:15.890000] so we're gonna look
at privacy and harassment law
448. [00:42:15.960000-00:42:18.260000] so you can find a combination
of cases
449. [00:42:18.320000-00:42:20.060000] to make an argument.
I'll take privacy.
450. [00:42:20.130000-00:42:21.690000] I'll take harassment law.
451. [00:42:21.760000-00:42:23.260000] This'll take a while.
452. [00:42:23.330000-00:42:24.930000] We're gonna need dinner.
453. [00:42:25-00:42:27.070000] - Chinese.
- No.
454. [00:42:27.140000-00:42:28.500000] I can afford Chinese on my own.
455. [00:42:28.570000-00:42:30.300000] This is on the firm.
I want sushi.
456. [00:42:30.370000-00:42:32.010000] Ooh.
457. [00:42:32.070000-00:42:34.210000] So they told me to put
my top investigator on it.
458. [00:42:34.280000-00:42:36.510000] - What did you do?
- What could I do?
459. [00:42:36.580000-00:42:38.280000] You were out of the country,
I gave them Luderman.
460. [00:42:40.120000-00:42:41.520000] By the way, that dress...
461. [00:42:41.580000-00:42:42.850000] What, this old thing?
Come on.
462. [00:42:42.920000-00:42:44.950000] Beautiful.
463. [00:42:45.020000-00:42:46.760000] Vanessa, why don't we do this
more often?
464. [00:42:46.820000-00:42:49.760000] 'Cause it always ends
the same way.
465. [00:42:49.830000-00:42:51.960000] Then why are we doing it now?
466. [00:42:52.030000-00:42:54.430000] Harvey, I don't sleep around.
467. [00:42:54.500000-00:42:56.860000] And I could never be
in a relationship with you.
468. [00:42:56.930000-00:42:59.100000] All you ever think about
is yourself.
469. [00:42:59.170000-00:43:01.740000] I'm thinking about you and me
right now.
470. [00:43:05.870000-00:43:07.410000] Please.
I insist.
471. [00:43:07.480000-00:43:08.610000] But I'm a gentleman.
472. [00:43:08.680000-00:43:10.780000] Besides, you came through
473. [00:43:10.850000-00:43:12.680000] on Dockery for me,
and I'm not one
474. [00:43:12.750000-00:43:14.580000] to forget a favor.
475. [00:43:14.650000-00:43:16.590000] Neither am I.
476. [00:43:22.730000-00:43:25.400000] Mr. Dockery,
you naughty, naughty boy.
477. [00:43:30.430000-00:43:33.640000] You remember when I said
you thought you were too smart
478. [00:43:33.710000-00:43:34.940000] to be a paralegal?
Mm-hmm.
479. [00:43:35.010000-00:43:37.040000] - Why...
- Aren't I a lawyer?
480. [00:43:37.110000-00:43:39.110000] Mm.
481. [00:43:39.180000-00:43:41.710000] I don't test well.
What?
482. [00:43:41.780000-00:43:43.810000] I am smart.
483. [00:43:43.880000-00:43:45.450000] And I know
I'd be a good lawyer.
484. [00:43:45.520000-00:43:46.880000] I just--I don't know
what it is.
485. [00:43:46.950000-00:43:47.850000] I can't take tests,
486. [00:43:47.920000-00:43:50.890000] and I bombed the lsats.
487. [00:43:50.960000-00:43:52.320000] And even if I could get
488. [00:43:52.390000-00:43:53.520000] into law school, there's no way
489. [00:43:53.590000-00:43:55.460000] I'd pass the bar.
490. [00:43:55.530000-00:44:00.060000] So if only there was someone
who could take the test for me.
491. [00:44:00.130000-00:44:02.430000] - Yeah, if only there were.
- Yeah.
492. [00:44:02.500000-00:44:05.300000] Hi. Where are you at
with the research
493. [00:44:05.370000-00:44:07.710000] for tomorrow's hearing?
Nothing yet.
494. [00:44:07.770000-00:44:08.710000] You say you care
about the client,
