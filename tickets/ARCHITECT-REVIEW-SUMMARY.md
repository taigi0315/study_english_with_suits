## Decision Breakdown

### ✅ Approved (3 tickets)
Organized into 3 phases over 4-6 weeks timeline

**Phase 1 (Sprint 1 - Weeks 1-2):** 1 ticket
**Phase 2 (Sprint 2 - Weeks 3-4):** 1 ticket
**Phase 3 (Sprint 3+ - Weeks 5-6+):** 1 ticket

**See full roadmap:** `tickets/approved/IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md`

### ❌ Deleted (1 ticket)

**TICKET-004: Consolidate Code Improvements**
- **Reason:** Placeholder ticket with no actionable content
- **Status:** Deleted - sub-items should be separate tickets if needed
- **Note:** Previous review tickets (TICKET-001 through TICKET-005 from earlier review) were already approved and moved

## Strategic Themes Addressed
1. **Performance Optimization** (TICKET-001): 1 ticket, 2-3 days
   - Impact: 3-5x faster expression analysis
   - Key ticket: TICKET-001
   
2. **Feature Enhancement** (TICKET-002): 1 ticket, 7-9 days
   - Impact: Richer educational content, better efficiency
   - Key ticket: TICKET-002
   
3. **Production Readiness** (TICKET-003): 1 ticket, 4-5 days
   - Impact: Consistent deployment, automation, security
   - Key ticket: TICKET-003

## Architectural Direction

### Immediate Focus (Phase 1 - Weeks 1-2)
**TICKET-001: Parallel LLM Processing**
- Leverage existing `ParallelProcessor` infrastructure
- Critical fix: Proposed implementation has sequential loop bug
- Performance: 3-5x improvement expected

### Medium-term (Phase 2 - Weeks 3-4)
**TICKET-002: Multiple Expressions Per Context**
- ExpressionGroup model (backward compatible)
- Separate mode default (maintains UX)
- Combined mode optional (can defer)

### Long-term (Phase 3 - Weeks 5-6+)
**TICKET-003: Production Dockerization**
- Simplified stack (API + Redis, optional PostgreSQL)
- Remove Celery from initial implementation (use FastAPI background tasks)
- CI/CD automation
- TrueNAS deployment

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Parallel Processing Implementation
- **Context:** Need to use existing `ExpressionBatchProcessor` correctly
- **Decision:** Extend `ExpressionBatchProcessor` to support `save_output`, use directly (no wrapper loops)
- **Rationale:** Existing infrastructure is solid, just needs proper integration
- **Impact:** Significant performance improvement, minimal code changes

### Decision 2: Multiple Expressions Strategy
- **Context:** Support multiple expressions per context while maintaining compatibility
- **Decision:** ExpressionGroup wrapper model, separate mode default, combined mode optional
- **Rationale:** Backward compatible, gradual enhancement path
- **Impact:** Richer content without breaking existing workflows

### Decision 3: Production Stack Simplification
- **Context:** TICKET-003 includes Celery but may not be actively used
- **Decision:** Make Celery optional, simplify to API + Redis + optional PostgreSQL
- **Rationale:** Right-sized for current needs, can add Celery later if distributed workers needed
- **Impact:** Simpler deployment, less maintenance burden

## Risks and Mitigations
**Highest risks identified:**

1. **TICKET-001: Sequential loop bug in proposed implementation**
   - Risk: No actual parallelization, no performance gain
   - Mitigation: Corrected implementation provided, code review required
   - Status: Critical fix documented in ticket

2. **TICKET-002: Breaking backward compatibility**
   - Risk: Existing single-expression workflows fail
   - Mitigation: Separate mode default, single expressions = groups of 1
   - Status: Design ensures compatibility

3. **TICKET-003: Over-engineering with unused services**
   - Risk: Complex deployment for no benefit
   - Mitigation: Simplified stack, remove Celery initially
   - Status: Scope adjusted

## Resource Requirements
- Timeline: 4-6 weeks (2-3 sprints)
- Skills needed:
  - Senior engineer: 2 weeks (TICKET-001, TICKET-002)
  - DevOps/senior backend engineer: 1 week (TICKET-003)
- Infrastructure: Docker, GitHub Actions (Phase 3)

## Success Criteria
We'll know this roadmap is successful when:
- [ ] Parallel processing provides 3x+ performance improvement
- [ ] Multiple expressions per context working (backward compatible)
- [ ] Production deployment automated and tested
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate:** Start TICKET-001 (parallel processing) - Week 1
2. **Week 3:** Start TICKET-002 (multi-expression support)
3. **Week 5+:** Start TICKET-003 (production deployment)
4. **Ongoing:** Monitor progress, adjust timeline as needed

## Feedback Welcome
This review prioritizes:
- **Performance**: Parallel processing for faster analysis
- **Features**: Richer content with multiple expressions
- **Operations**: Production-grade deployment

If business priorities shift or new information emerges, we can revisit decisions.

Areas particularly open to discussion:
- Celery usage: Current state and future needs
- Combined mode timing: Phase 2 vs defer to Phase 3
- Deployment target: TrueNAS vs other platforms
