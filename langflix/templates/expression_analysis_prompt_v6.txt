Here is a segment of dialogue from the TV show "{show_name}":

{dialogues}

**⚠️ CRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT:**
- The **catchy_keywords** field MUST BE 100% IN {target_language} (Korean). NEVER WRITE ENGLISH KEYWORDS.
- The **title** field MUST BE 100% IN {target_language} (Korean). NEVER WRITE ENGLISH TITLES.
- Examples: "숨겨진 속내 드러나다", "상사의 뼈때리는 한마디", "직장 드라마 레전드"
- ❌ WRONG: "Harvey's witty comeback", "Funny Food Banter"
- ✅ CORRECT: "하비의 재치있는 반격", "웃기는 음식 농담"

**YOUR MISSION:**
Find the best expression that English learners would be EXCITED to learn - expressions they'd actually use and remember.

**CRITICAL: FOCUS ON HIGH-ENERGY, MEMORABLE MOMENTS**
When selecting expressions, prioritize scenes with strong emotional impact or entertainment value. The best expressions often come from moments that are:
- **😂 HUMOROUS:** Funny, witty, sarcastic, or laugh-out-loud moments.
- **🔥 INTENSE/DRAMATIC:** High tension, conflict, confrontation, or high stakes.
- **😍 SEXY/ROMANTIC:** Flirty, charming, or romantically charged interactions.
- **😲 SURPRISING:** Unexpected twists or reveals that grab attention.

Think about what would make a short video clip go viral. If the scene makes you laugh, gasp, or feel something strong, it's a prime candidate.

**IMPORTANT:** You can extract UP TO {max_expressions} expressions from this dialogue segment.
Choose the BEST expressions - prioritize quality over filling the quota.
Each expression should come from a DIFFERENT, NON-OVERLAPPING time range.
If there aren't enough high-quality expressions, it's OK to return fewer.

**LANGUAGE LEVEL:** {level_description}

---

**THE NORTH STAR PRINCIPLE:**
Ask yourself: "Would I be excited to share THIS clip with a friend because it's hilarious, intense, or awesome?"

If the answer is YES because:
- ✓ It's a scene that grabs attention (funny/dramatic/sexy/tense)
- ✓ The expression is used naturally in this high-energy moment
- ✓ It's memorable because of the scene's impact
- ✓ Learners would actually say this in their daily life

Then it's worth extracting.

If the answer is NO because:
- ✗ The scene is boring, flat, or procedural
- ✗ It's too obvious or simple
- ✗ It's too specific to this one situation
- ✗ It's awkward phrasing or too formal/legal jargon

Then skip it.

---

**WHAT MAKES AN EXPRESSION "BEST":**

**1. HIGH-IMPACT SCENE** (Crucial for engagement)
The expression appears in a scene that is:
- Humorous, dramatic, tense, emotional, sexy, or witty
- NOT boring procedural talk or flat information delivery
- Has energy and personality that makes the clip highly watchable
- Makes the expression memorable through emotion or entertainment

**2. COMMON & REUSABLE**
- Used frequently by native speakers across different situations
- Not tied to just legal/office settings - can be used in everyday life
- Something you'd hear in conversations, movies, casual settings
- Test: "Would native speakers use this expression at least once a week?"
- **COMPLEXITY REQUIREMENT:** The expression should be substantial enough to be worth learning:
  * Multi-word phrases (3+ words preferred): "get on my nerves", "blow off steam", "cut to the chase"
  * Phrasal verbs with interesting usage: "put up with", "come up with", "figure out"
  * NOT simple curses or basic 1-2 word phrases: avoid "bullshit", "screw you", "damn it"
  * The expression should have a non-obvious meaning or usage pattern

**3. CLEARLY USEFUL**
- Idiomatic expressions, phrasal verbs, or colloquial phrases
- Not just regular vocabulary or obvious statements
- Appropriate for your target level: {level_description}

---

**STRICT FILTERS - NEVER EXTRACT:**
- ✗ Plain statements with no special expression ("I agree", "That's good")
- ✗ Scene-specific phrases that only work in this exact context
- ✗ Overly formal legal jargon (unless it's commonly used in general conversation)
- ✗ Random sentence fragments that aren't actual expressions
- ✗ Boring exchanges with no emotional energy
- ✗ Expressions that are self-explanatory and obvious

---

**UNDERSTANDING THE STORY FIRST:**

Before extracting expressions, take time to understand:
1. **What's the emotional hook?** - Is it funny? Tense? Sexy? Dramatic?
2. **What's happening in this scene?** - The situation, conflict, or interaction
3. **Who are the characters?** - Their relationships and motivations
4. **Why does this moment matter?** - What makes it interesting or memorable?

This understanding will help you:
- Select the most engaging expressions from high-impact scenes
- Provide context that tells a compelling mini-story
- Create translations that capture the natural flow, emotion, and nuance (의역), not just literal words (직역)

---

**CONTEXT DESIGN - TELL A MINI-STORY:**

**GOAL:** Learners should be enthralled by the story segment AND learn the expression naturally.

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLES:**

1. **LONGER, STORY-RICH CONTEXT (25-45 seconds typical)**
   - Give enough dialogue to understand WHO these people are and WHAT'S happening
   - Include the setup that makes the expression make sense and builds tension/humor
   - Include reactions that show the impact or meaning
   - Let viewers follow the narrative flow naturally

2. **EXPRESSION PLACEMENT:**
   - The expression should appear naturally in the middle of the story
   - NOT at the very beginning (needs setup)
   - NOT at the very end (needs reaction/closure)

3. **COMPLETE STORY ARC:**
   - **Beginning:** Establish situation/conflict/hook (3-8 seconds)
   - **Middle:** Expression appears in context (2-5 seconds)
   - **End:** Reaction/response that completes the moment (3-8 seconds)

4. **START AND END POINTS:**
   - **Start Time:** Begin when the situation/topic begins (NEVER mid-sentence)
   - **End Time:** End when the moment feels complete and resolved (NEVER cutting someone off)
   - **Include full sentences at boundaries** - no partial phrases

**LENGTH GUIDELINES:**
- **Minimum:** 25 seconds (rarely shorter - only for very simple, self-contained exchanges)
- **Sweet Spot:** 30-40 seconds (most expressions work best here)
- **Maximum:** 45 seconds (for complex situations requiring more setup)

**Quick Test:**
- Can someone who's never seen the show understand what's happening?
- Does it feel like a complete, engaging mini-scene?
- Would learners enjoy watching this clip just for the entertainment value?
- Is the expression's usage crystal clear from the context?

---

**CRITICAL: NO OVERLAPPING CLIPS - CREATE A CONTINUOUS VIEWING EXPERIENCE**

**THE BIG PICTURE:**
When all extracted clips are played in chronological order, learners should be able to watch the entire episode naturally - like watching a movie with no repeated scenes. Each clip should pick up where the previous one left off or jump forward in the story.

**ABSOLUTE RULES:**

1. **ZERO OVERLAP BETWEEN CLIPS:**
   - If you extract multiple expressions from DIFFERENT dialogue segments, their time ranges must NEVER overlap
   - Previous clip ends at time X → Next clip must start at time X or later
   - Example: 
     * Clip 1: 00:05:30 - 00:06:10 ✓
     * Clip 2: 00:06:10 - 00:06:50 ✓ (starts exactly where Clip 1 ended)
     * Clip 2: 00:06:05 - 00:06:45 ✗ (overlaps with Clip 1 by 5 seconds - NEVER DO THIS)

2. **CHRONOLOGICAL STORY FLOW:**
   - Extract expressions in the order they appear in the episode
   - Each new clip should advance the story forward
   - Learners should feel they're watching the episode unfold naturally
   - Gaps between clips are OK (story jumps forward)
   - Overlaps are NOT OK (story repeats itself)

3. **WHEN EXPRESSIONS ARE CLOSE TOGETHER:**
   If multiple good expressions appear within the same context:
   **You may select MULTIPLE expressions if they don't overlap:**
   - Each expression needs its own separate context (start/end times)
   - Context time ranges must NOT overlap
   - This is how to maximize value per API call

4. **CONTEXT BOUNDARIES MUST NOT OVERLAP:**
   - **CRITICAL:** Different contexts (different `context_start_time`/`context_end_time`) must NEVER overlap
   - Before finalizing your selection, review all `context_start_time` and `context_end_time` values
   - Sort contexts chronologically by `context_start_time`
   - Verify that each context's start time is ≥ previous context's end time
   - **Rule:** Context A ends at X, Context B must start at X or later (X < Context B start)
   - If you find ANY overlap between different contexts, adjust or remove one of them
   - **Remember:** Each context must have exactly ONE expression. Different contexts must not overlap.

**VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:**
Before submitting your JSON output, verify:
- ✓ All clips are sorted by start time (earliest to latest)
- ✓ No clip's start time is before a previous clip's end time
- ✓ Together, clips tell a forward-moving story with no repetition
- ✓ If clips are back-to-back, they feel like one continuous scene
- ✓ If there are gaps, they feel like natural story progression (time jump forward)

**CATCHY CONTEXT KEYWORDS - HOOK THE VIEWER:**

**PURPOSE:** Generate 2-3 short, punchy phrases in {target_language} (3-6 words each) that make people think "Wait, WHAT? I need to see this!" within 2-3 seconds. These should feel like engaging social media captions.

**CHARACTERISTICS OF GREAT KEYWORDS:**

1. **REVEAL THE JUICY PART & EMOTION** without spoiling everything
   - Hint at conflict, surprise, drama, humor, or romance
   - Create curiosity: "How did THAT happen?" or "Did they just say that?"
   - Examples: "보스랑 소개팅하게 된 썰", "이새끼를 죽여 살려?!", "회사 짤리고 엄마한테 등짝맞는 얘기"

2. **FOCUS ON THE UNEXPECTED & HIGH STAKES**
   - What's surprising, unusual, or highly relatable about this scene?
   - What would make someone stop scrolling immediately?
   - What's the dramatic "hook" that makes this moment special?

3. **USE POWER WORDS & STRONG VERBS**
   - Words that create emotion: 대박, 충격, 반전, 설렘, 위기, 비밀, 폭소
   - Action words: 들이받다, 고백하다, 들키다, 터지다, 맞서다
   - Dramatic words: 진실, 결정, 선택, 최악의 상황

4. **DIFFERENT ANGLES** for the same scene:
   - Keyword 1: Character/Relatable perspective ("상사한테 대들다 짤림")
   - Keyword 2: Conflict/Drama angle ("내 뒷담화하다 딱 걸린 동료")
   - Keyword 3: Humor/Situation ("첫 데이트에 전애인 만남")

**FORMAT:**
- Each keyword: 3-6 words in {target_language}
- NO full sentences, NO explanations
- Short, punchy, scroll-stopping
- Think: "TikTok/Reel caption style" - colloquial, engaging, maybe slightly provocative

**BAD EXAMPLES (too bland):**
- ❌ "면접을 보는 장면" (too descriptive, no hook)
- ❌ "변호사 사무실에서 대화" (too generic)
- ❌ "마이크와 하비의 만남" (no drama)

**GOOD EXAMPLES:**
- ✓ "보스랑 소개팅하게 된 썰"
- ✓ "이새끼를 죽여 살려?!"
- ✓ "회사 짤리고 엄마한테 등짝맞는 얘기"
- ✓ "천재의 즉석 면접 통과"
- ✓ "하버드 없이 로펌 입성"

**PROCESS:**
1. Identify what's dramatic/surprising/emotional/funny about this scene
2. Brainstorm 5-6 possible angles, focusing on the hook
3. Pick the top 2-3 that would make YOU click/watch
4. Keep them short and punchy (3-6 words)

---

**EXTRACTING THE EXPRESSION - GIVE MORE CONTEXT:**

**NEW APPROACH: Expand the phrase to include meaningful context**

Instead of extracting just the bare minimum phrase, include enough surrounding words to make the expression's usage pattern clear and natural.

**EXAMPLES:**

❌ TOO SHORT (old way):
- "figure out"
- "deal with"
- "come up with"

✅ BETTER (new way - includes usage context):
- "figure out what to do"
- "deal with this situation"
- "come up with a solution"
- "I can't deal with this right now"
- "We need to figure out how to handle this"

**GUIDELINES:**
- Include the verb AND its natural object/complement when relevant
- Include necessary prepositions or particles that show usage
- Include subject pronouns if they're part of the natural usage pattern
- Make it a chunk that learners can memorize and reuse
- Still focus on the KEY phrase, but give it breathing room

**BALANCE:**
- Don't make it so long it becomes a full sentence
- Don't make it so short it's unclear how to use it
- Aim for 4-8 words typically
- It should feel like a natural "chunk" of language

---

**SHORT VIDEO CONTEXT DURATION (if applicable):**

For short videos (≤ 60 seconds total):
- Context must be ≤ 40 seconds
- Remaining ~20 seconds reserved for expression slides
- When finding contexts, prioritize segments that are ≤ 40 seconds
- If no suitable context ≤ 40 seconds exists, use the best available context but note it may not fit short video format

**EXPRESSION COUNT:**
- Find {min_expressions} to {max_expressions} expressions from this dialogue segment
- Each expression MUST have a DIFFERENT, NON-OVERLAPPING context time range
- Quality over quantity: Only extract expressions that pass ALL quality checks
- It's OK to return fewer than {max_expressions} if there aren't enough high-quality expressions

---

**TRANSLATION STRATEGY - 의역 (Natural Translation):**

**CRITICAL: Translations should feel natural in {target_language}, not word-for-word.**

**For DIALOGUE translations:**
- Translate how a real person would say it in {target_language}
- Capture the emotion, nuance, and intention, not just literal words
- Consider the relationship between speakers and the situation (formal vs informal)
- Make it flow naturally as if it were originally in {target_language}

**For EXPRESSION translations:**
- Focus on the functional meaning in this specific context
- Use {target_language} expressions that convey the same feeling and tone
- Adapt to the story and emotional tone
- If there's a perfect {target_language} equivalent idiom, use it
- If not, explain the meaning naturally in {target_language}

**EXAMPLE:**
- Literal (직역): "그것을 공원 밖으로 치다" ❌
- Natural (의역): "완벽하게 해내다" ✓

---

**EXPRESSION_DIALOGUE - COMPLETE SENTENCES ONLY:**

**CRITICAL RULE: Never cut a sentence in the middle**

- **expression_dialogue** must be a COMPLETE, FULL sentence from the subtitles
- Start from the beginning of the sentence (capital letter or after period/question mark/exclamation)
- End at the sentence's natural end (period, question mark, exclamation point)
- Include all words from start to finish - no cutting

**EXAMPLES:**

❌ WRONG (cut in middle):
- "really need to figure this out"
- "can't believe you would"

✅ CORRECT (full sentence):
- "We really need to figure this out."
- "I can't believe you would do this to me."
- "Are you seriously going to make me deal with this alone?"

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
- Learners need to see proper sentence structure
- Partial sentences confuse grammar understanding
- Complete sentences show natural English rhythm and flow

---

**VOCABULARY ANNOTATIONS - DYNAMIC WORD HIGHLIGHTS:**

**PURPOSE:** Identify 1-3 interesting/difficult vocabulary words from the dialogues that will appear as dynamic overlays when spoken.

**WHAT TO ANNOTATE:**
- ✓ Slang terms (e.g., "douchebag", "busted", "screw over")
- ✓ Idioms within the dialogue (e.g., "off the hook", "on the same page")
- ✓ Culturally-specific terms that need explanation
- ✓ Difficult words for intermediate learners
- ✓ Words that add color/meaning to the scene

**WHAT NOT TO ANNOTATE:**
- ✗ The main expression itself (that's shown separately)
- ✗ Common words everyone knows ("the", "is", "good")
- ✗ Words that are self-explanatory from context

**FORMAT:**
```json
"vocabulary_annotations": [
  {{"word": "douchebag", "translation": "멍청이", "dialogue_index": 0}},
  {{"word": "code red", "translation": "강력한 경고", "dialogue_index": 5}}
]
```

**DIALOGUE_INDEX:** The 0-indexed position in the `dialogues` array where this word appears.
- If word is in dialogues[0], dialogue_index = 0
- If word is in dialogues[3], dialogue_index = 3

---

**PROCESS:**

**STEP 0:** Read and understand the entire scene
   - What's the story here?
   - Who are these people and what do they want?
   - What's the emotion, tension, humor, or hook?

**STEP 1:** Scan the dialogue for expressions that pass the North Star test, focusing on high-impact moments.

**STEP 2:** Rank them by:
   1. How engaging and high-energy the scene is (Humor/Drama/Tension/Sexy)
   2. How common/reusable the expression is
   3. How appropriate for the target level

**STEP 3:** For each top expression, design story-rich context:
   - Plan 25-45 seconds for regular videos (or ≤ 40 seconds for short videos) that tells a complete mini-story
   - Ensure the expression appears naturally in the middle
   - Verify learners can follow what's happening and feel the impact

**STEP 4:** Select UP TO {max_expressions} expressions with NON-OVERLAPPING time ranges. Quality over quantity.
