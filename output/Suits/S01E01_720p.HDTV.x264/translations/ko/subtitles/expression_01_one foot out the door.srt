1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,630
You've had one foot
out the door
그렇지 않나?

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,470
since you got here.
What are you talking about?
넌 여기에 온 이후로

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,800
I'm talking
about that briefcase
항상 한 발은 문 밖에 걸쳐 놨었어.

4
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,510
being locked in your desk.
Yeah, I saw it.
무슨 소리예요?

5
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,470
And I know what it is.
네 책상에 잠겨 있는

6
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,810
It's your backup plan
in case this doesn't work out.
그 서류 가방 말이야.

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,640
You can make some quick cash
and go right back
그래, 봤어.

8
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,950
to the life you told me
you didn't want to lead.
그리고 그게 뭔지도 알지.
